            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>He is ſenſible that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His Ambition, or rather His Deſtiny, could make Him amends for the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes they have plung'd Him in, than by ſuffering Him to reappear in the World under Your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Commiſſion. If He ſucceeds in this Requeſt, He queſtions not to Reign again with as much Glory and Luſtre, as He was
<pb facs="tcp:57998:4"/>before oppreſs'd with the Malignity and Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of His Fate.</p>
                  <p>To You, <hi>Madam,</hi> He flies for Refuge, knowing the Whole Univerſe muſt pay Veneration to ſuch an Aſyle, and that the Sactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary cannot but be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is ſupported by ſo much Beauty, ſo much Wit and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>He is aſſur'd His greateſt Enemies will be forc'd to court His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when under Your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;

                  <p>But he is moſt capable of telling His own Story:

                  <head>Don Sebaſtian, KING OF <hi>PORTUGAL.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the firſt Years of the Reign of <hi>Don Sebaſtian, Portugal</hi> was the moſt Peaceable and Flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Kingdom of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The Diviſions and Conteſts about Religion, which ſo cruelly ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Provinces, had not ſpread their fury into that Country: And ever ſince <hi>Don Alphonſo Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>William Long-ſword,</hi> had chaced the <hi>Moors</hi> out of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, the Quiet of that People had not been troubled by any fears. This King had hardly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his fifteenth year, but he made himſelf admired by all his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57998:8"/>People, and fear'd by all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: The vivacity of his Wit, the elevation of his Soul, the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity he made appear in all his Exerciſes, and the greatneſs of his Courage, rendred him the moſt accompliſhed Prince of that Age. He was Handſome, well made, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and Liberal: He had a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Port, Royal Inclinations, and it ſeemed as if Nature had taken leiſure to form him with all the Qualities that can make a Prince recommendable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. A crowd of young Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who were brought up with him, or whom the deſire of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing themſelves by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes, had drawn from all parts to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> compoſed his moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Court. And as Youth, Amours, and Pleaſures have ever been inſeparable, and as Love is the firſt and ſofteſt amuſement of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, all theſe Courtiers inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly applyed themſelves more to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57998:8"/>their Miſtreſſes, than to their Prince; and their hearts being little touched with Ambition, made them give ſighs to Love, when they fancied they rendred Aſſiduities to Fortune.</p>
                  <p>That Court was made up of Perſons of extraordinary Merit: Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> the Kings Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, was no leſs elevated above thoſe of her Sex, by her Virtue than by her Quality. She had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver applyed her ſelf with a great deal of Prudence and Succeſs to diſſipate the troubles that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the State, during the Infancy of <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> And when this young Prince took upon him the Government of his Kingdom, ſhe gave her ſelf entirely to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all thoſe Virtues that can recommend a Queen to the World. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> had a great ſhare of Wit and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and though ſhe had a Son of the ſame age with the King, ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57998:9"/>deſpaired not of charming that Prince, and employ'd all her Arts to inſpire him with Friendſhip, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, or Affection. She was much in <hi>Katherine</hi>'s favour, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her ſelf with ſo much Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that Acting as well the part of a <hi>Lucretia</hi> as of a Goſſip, ſhe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all the Exerciſes of the Queens Devotion, and in all the Matches of the Kings Divertiſements. The Duke her Husband knowing her heart to be too ſuſceptible of Ambition to be the like of Love, ſuffered her with Tranquility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Young Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> their Son; and was himſelf almoſt always at his Country-Houſe. <hi>Eugenia,</hi> whoſe Relations had ever had the moſt conſiderable Charges of the State, admirably well maintained her Quality in that Court: She was brown, of an advantageous Shape, and had a ſweet and ſolid Wit: And though ſhe had loſt her Father
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57998:9"/>and Mother when ſhe was very young, her Carriage had been ever ſo regular, that ſhe gave as much admiration for her Virtue, as for her Beauty. <hi>Chriſtopher de Cavora,</hi> who was Maſter of the Horſe to the King, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, had a Daughter called <hi>Leonora;</hi> who, maugre her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, was already the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court, and with her Blooming Beauty made the moſt inſenſible to tremble.</p>
                  <p>That Court was filled with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Perſons, who had no leſs merit than thoſe I have mentioned; though they were of a leſs Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated condition. <hi>Violanta</hi> was of theſe laſt: She was Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a perfect Beauty and infinite Deſerts, and if her Charms were proper to give Birth to a great Paſſion, her heart was capable of being ſenſible of the like.</p>
                  <p>But all the luſtre of the Court
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57998:10"/>was not confined within the Circle of the Beauty of this Sex, the Men made there likewiſe admirable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. Cardinal <hi>Henry, Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Uncle, had ever made appear great deal of Conduct in the Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, that was committed to him, of the Young King. <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who was likewiſe his Uncle, had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized his Courage in ſeveral Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and with Juſtice paſſed for the braveſt and handſomeſt Prince of that Kingdom. He had had a long time a very tender En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with <hi>Violanta;</hi> and the report even run at Court, that he had Married her, and by her had a Son, whom he brought up at one of his Houſes near <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> had made his Prudence and Valour appear on ſeveral occaſions under the Reign of <hi>John</hi> the III, and had been one of his Favourites; but Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> had no great kindneſs for him, knowing him to be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57998:10"/>and daring. The Young Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> gave great hopes of his Dexterity and Wit, and began to view of the Beauty of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> with a tender emotion. The Count <hi>de Souſa</hi> was much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both by the King and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Henry:</hi> He maintained his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by a great merit, and had taken care to joyn to all the fine Qualities that make a well bred-Man, the ſolid Virtues that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an honeſt-man. <hi>Don Henry</hi> had a thouſand good Qualities, that made him be beloved by all the World, he was well Built, and Vallant, and breathed nothing but dangers: And as he was the chief of an Illuſtrious Family both for Nobility and Riches; his Father had taken care before his Death, to Conclude his Marriage with <hi>Eugenia,</hi> they having loved one another from their moſt tender Infancy. All things ſeem'd to conſpire to unite them; their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57998:11"/>being alike, their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſuitable, and their Age almoſt equal, gave all People great hopes of their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Amours were the Soul of that Court, and even thoſe who were only ſenſible of Ambition were conſtrained to call Love to their ſuccours, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceed in their Deſigns. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> would have been willing to have been indept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the advancement of her Fortune to this laſt Paſſion; ſhe placed all her cares to make the King love her; but was not able to render his heart ſenſible: He had no other Paſſion than for Arms, he had raiſed a Regiment which he Exerciſed continually, and frequently Review'd: He would as often undertake the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Common Souldiers, as the Cares of chief Officers, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perils had a ſecret Charm to invite him, and not believing that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57998:11"/>any common danger was worthy of him, he would not undertake any thing that was not attended with difficulties: If he had any Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to make upon the Sea, he affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Embark during the Tempeſt, diſdaining to rock peaceably in a Calm that might lull his Virtue aſleep. Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> had no leſs Ambition than the Dutcheſs of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi> and likewiſe fancied that Love might be uſeful to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. He had a Daughter called <hi>Elvira:</hi> He ſought in her Beauty for the reputation that was refuſed his own merit, and imagin'd that ſhe had Charms enough to touch the heart of that Young King: She had not yet been ſeen at Court, though ſhe was at an Age to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there with luſtre, becauſe the Dutcheſs her Mother, having a long time languiſhed in a Diſeaſe which occaſioned her Death two Years before, had retired her ſelf to one of her Country Houſes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57998:12"/>and had ever kept her with her; and the Duke, after the Death of his Wife, had put his Daughter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Nunnery near his Houſe, not deſigning to take her from thence, till he had found out a Match ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Eugenia</hi> had too many Charms to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Conqueſt of <hi>Don Henry.</hi> The <hi>Count de Souſa</hi> had been long Paſſionately in love with her: His Reſpects, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances and Aſſiduities had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſſured her of it; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was not willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, or ſhe had only Eyes for <hi>Don Henry,</hi> the <hi>Count de Souſa</hi> always found in her ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference for him, that he judg'd it not convenient to declare his Paſſion more openly: He had too much reſpect and diſcretion to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard an unprofitable Declaration. <hi>Don Henry</hi> was his Friend, <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> had ever ſeen him only under the notion of Friendſhip, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57998:12"/>he could not any longer ſupport the conſtraint of: He ſaw her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; ſhe was ever lovely in his Eyes; ſhe had hardly in the leaſt concealed from him the Paſſion ſhe had for <hi>Henry:</hi> That Lover likewiſe made him the Confident of his happineſs. What a torture is this to a Man, whoſe love is extream, and was not capable of eaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by betraying his Miſtreſs and his Friend? After having been for ſome time in theſe Extremities, and having in vain Employ'd the Succours of his Reaſon for to cure him, he fancied, that abſence would diminiſh his Sufferings, by weakning his Paſſion, and ſo was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to remove from Court; but his Merit had put him there in too good a poſture for him to go away without ſome ſpecious pretext.</p>

                     <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> the II. had Married in his third Nuptials, died in <hi>Spain</hi> about that time; wherefore one was to be ſent to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57998:13"/>make the Compliments of Condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to this King on the behalf of Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> his Siſter, and <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> his Nephew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Souſa</hi> fancied that occaſion was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him, and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Commiſſion, he Employed <hi>Cardinal Henry</hi>'s Credit with the King; the Cardinal highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Virtue, uſed to Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> the Solicitations of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> his Friend; whoſe Birth and Piety were had in veneration by all People; and whom that King had cauſed to come from <hi>Spain</hi> to communicate to her, all that concerned the Salvation of her Soul and the good of the Kingdom. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what he deſired, was ſent to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but could not depart without going to take his leave of <hi>Eugenia,</hi> with whom he found <hi>Don Henry.</hi> He uſed all his endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his Grief, and his Love in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57998:13"/>that ſeparation; the Words he ſpoke had no coherence with one another, and the Sighs he vented were half ſtifled: And ſeeing he could not reſiſt his Grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he quitted thoſe two Lovers, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them, bidding 'em, <hi>Farewell, and live happy, while I do lead a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing life, far from you and my Friends.</hi> His Sighs hindred him from ſpeaking more than theſe Words; he went immediately away for fear they ſhould ſee him ſhed tears: And <hi>Eugenia</hi> and <hi>Don Henry</hi> were really afflicted at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and attributed to Friendſhip alone, what a more violent Paſſion had produced.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d'Avero,</hi> cauſed <hi>Elvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> to come and ſecond his Projects: He was himſelf ſurpriz'd with her Beauty, and conceived freſh hopes at the ſight of ſo dazeling an Object. The truth is, ſhe was capable so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the moſt inſenſible: Her blew Eyes were ſweet and piercing; all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57998:14"/>her Features were regular, her Complexion was admirable, and Hair was the fineſt in the World, delicately accompanied by all the Beauty of her Face: She was of a middle Stature, but her Wit was above what is common; ſhe had an inſinuating Prefence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ways with her; her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was eaſie, of a ſoft hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and a Gentle Soul. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would at firſt inſtruct her with the meaſures ſhe ought to keep in regard of all the Perſons that compoſed the Court, into which he would introduce her: But found in her ſo much Wir, ſo much Judgment, and a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo Natural to ſecond his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he had nothing elſe to do than to deſcribe to her, the different Characters of thoſe, who held the firſt Rank. The day after ſhe arrived, the Duke Conducted her to Queen <hi>Katherines</hi> Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to pay her her Reſpects. Her
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57998:14"/>Dreſs admirably well ſeconded her Beauty; the Queen found her the Lovelieſt Perſon ſhe had ever ſeen: The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza, Eugenia, Leonora, Violanta,</hi> and all thoſe who were there, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with her Luſtre. After which they examined all her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a Jealous Spite, and not finding any defect, they all fancied they ſaw in her a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Rival, who was going to raviſh all their Conqueſts from them. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> more Jealous than any other, would ſee if her Wit was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her Charms. She ſaid to her, all ſhe thought would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex her, and all the others by the ſame motive, Engaged her in a Converſation upon ſeveral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but ſhe ever reply'd with ſo much Sweetneſs and Wit, that they even admired her againſt their Will.</p>
                  <p>This Converſation was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57998:15"/>by the Count <hi>de Tavora,</hi> who came to acquaint the Queen, that the King was a coming. She immediately Commanded all thoſe in her Chamber not to make <hi>Elvira</hi> known, and bid the Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> retire, for fear of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her. He obeyed with ſome vexation, ardently deſiring to be a Witneſs of the interview of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> and his Daughter. The King came, <hi>Elvira</hi> was the firſt Object he ſaw, and he was ſo lively ſtruck, that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without being able to ſpeak, and without knowing what he ſhould ſay; a thouſand confuſed Motions agitated him at that ſight, and he was ſenſible of 'em all, but could not diſtinguiſh any; and of all the ſeveral thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing then in his Mind, he was not able to know or explain any, but that which told him that <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi> was the moſt Beautiful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World. All the Court
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57998:15"/>perceived the Kings trouble, and as he ſaw the Queen likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, he endeavoured to ſpeak, and conceal his diſorder: <hi>Who it that Charming Perſon, you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliſhed the Court with, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to the Queen, ſtill eyeing <hi>Elvira? She is a Native of</hi> Spain, anſwered ſhe, <hi>whom King</hi> Philip <hi>my Brother has ſent me, to be of the number of my Maids; but not being willing to have any more, I am going to ſend her back: For Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake don't ſend her back,</hi> (he interrupted her with a tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t would be but an ill return to the Civilities of the King of</hi> Spain: <hi>Well then,</hi> reply'd the Queen ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>I will not ſend her back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt Conſulting you, and ſhe ſhall have your leave if ſhe returns.</hi> The King clearly faw they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his diſorder, he bluſhed; and <hi>Elvira,</hi> who had ever had her Eyes down from the time the King entred, raiſed 'em at that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57998:16"/>inſtant, and met with thoſe of that Prince, but ſo tenderly and ſo paſſionately, that ſhe bluſht, and was in as great a Confuſion as himſelf. The Queen after ſome other Diſcourſes, at length ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> how this Lady was the Duke <hi>d' Avero</hi>'s Daughter. He was as little capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſſembling the joy this News gave him, as he had been to conceal the diſorder that the ſight of <hi>Elvira</hi> had cauſed in him. He made her a thouſand tender Compliments, and the day being already much advanced, and the Queen uſing to withdraw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, every one took leave of her and retired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> went to her Father's, with the Women who had waited on her, and was at firſt in ſome trouble, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had raiſed Motions in her, which ſhe was not acquainted with, and which ſhe however attributed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57998:16"/>ſhe had well examined 'em, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the reſpect that the looks of a King inſpire. She was ſtill making theſe Reflexions, when the Duke her Father entred her Appartment, to know what ſhe thought of the Court. She anſwered him very exactly upon all the different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters ſhe had ſeen there. But when he asked her, if the King had been there, if ſhe had ſeen him, and what ſhe thought of him, ſhe made appear ſo much diſorder in her Face and underſtanding, that the Duke divined the reaſon of that Confuſion, and changed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe immediately. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> retired with ſentiments very different from thoſe of <hi>Elvira:</hi> She was Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Jealous, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: She aimed at the heart, or rather the grandeur of the King. She knew from that moment that <hi>Elvira</hi> was capable of depriving her of both; and Ambition and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57998:17"/>inſpired her with an averſion for that Rival, that her Policy would hardly diſſemble; but amongſt all the different Motions this Viſit had cauſed, there were none ſo lively and ſo tender as thoſe of the King. He was ſo full of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Beauty, that it was impoſſible for him to ſpeak of any thing elſe as long as Supper laſted. He lay all Night thinking of her Charms; fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that the bluſhing he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in her Face, when their Eyes met, was a good preſage for his Love; and that her Eyes were ever too animated for it to be a meer Modeſty, which had given occaſion to this Confuſion. <hi>How happy,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhould I be to be beloved by this Charming Perſon: How Beautiful is ſhe, and how Rich in Wit and Sweetneſs! And how miſerable ſhould I be,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he immediately after, <hi>if her heart were engaged, or if it were inſenſible.</hi> For ſome moments that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57998:17"/>fear interrupted the delights of thoſe Reflections, but his hopes coming immediately to his help, calmed his Mind and revived his Affection.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d' Avero</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to know what Effects his Daughters Beauty had produced, did not fail to be the next day at the Kings riſing, who, as ſoon as he ſaw him, cryed out to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud: <hi>Ah Duke: how Charming is your Daughter, and how Beautiful did I find her Yeſterday?</hi> The Duke was ſo good a Courtier, as to take this Compliment kindly, and every one made him ſome upon this Subject, and the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> approaching him, told him, <hi>The Dutcheſs my Mother has made me ſo advantageous a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of her Wit and Beauty, that the very recital Charmed me.</hi> The truth is, that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who foreſaw the King would have a very great Paſſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57998:18"/>for <hi>Elvira,</hi> was deſirous that the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> might fall in love with her, for traverſing this Commerce which ſhe fear'd. But if by chance <hi>Elvira</hi> ſhould have any inclination for this Young Duke, then ſhe might at leaſt become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary through the part her Son would take in that Intreague, and by the abſolute power ſhe had over him.</p>
                  <p>But neceſſary it was, he ſhould declare himſelf ſpeedily, and not ſtay till the King had explained his budding Paſſion. Wherefore ſhe paſſed over Formalities, and went the next day with her Son to ſee <hi>Elvira. You will find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her entring, <hi>my Viſit raſh and too haſty, Madam; this is not the only fatigue your Beauty will cauſe you, and the Duke to whom I made Yeſter day the recital of it, has forced me to come and importune you with ſo much precipitation: But he is ſtill Young Madam,</hi> continued ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57998:18"/>ſmiling, <hi>and knows not what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Elvira</hi> anſwered with a thouſand Civilities. At this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Converſation was leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and more warm than uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe are of the firſt Viſits, and the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> ſhewed ſo much admiration for <hi>Elvira,</hi> that the Count <hi>de Tavora,</hi> who was then there, fancied he had conceived a great Paſſion for her, and ſaid, the day following, in Entertaining ſome Perſons that came to ſee him, with the News of the Court, that <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made a great noiſe there, that the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in love with her, had been to ſee her, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her a great deal of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonora</hi> was preſent at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and could not hear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhivering. For above two Years that the Duke de <hi>Barcellos</hi> ſaw her with aſſiduity, he had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57998:19"/>not dared to declare what her Charms had made him ſuffer; and their hearts having been uſed to love one another from their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Infancy, upon the credit of their ſighs, without having otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themſelves, they had ſpared themſelves the vexation, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions give at the birth of a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the confuſion which theſe forts of Declarations cauſe in thoſe that hear them: She returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber to conceal her trouble; and as ſoon as ſhe was at liberty, ſhe let ſome tears fall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the reaſon that made her weep: She ſaw her ſelf oppreſt with a grief that ſhe had never felt; ſometimes ſhe abandoned her ſelf to all imaginable hatred againſt <hi>Elvira,</hi> ſometimes ſhe complained confuſedly of the Duke of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellos;</hi> and not knowing what Motions to keep to, <hi>Why ſhould I complain of him,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me never to love any one?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57998:19"/>has he told me, he had a kindneſs for me? does he know that I have an inclination for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rather, have ever loved him? Alas, I know nothing of it my ſelf,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>but I know very well, I have been deceived in the opinion I had of the care he took to purchaſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my favour.</hi> She had not yet ſo ſtrictly Examined the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe had of the Duke <hi>de Barcellos;</hi> ſhe durſt not even in that moment tell her ſelf, that ſhe loved him, and attributed to the hatred ſhe had for <hi>Elvira,</hi> all that the ſtrongeſt Jealouſie made her ſuffer. <hi>I ſhould not care,</hi> ſaid ſhe ſometimes, <hi>though he loved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but I have ſo great an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy for</hi> Elvira, <hi>that I cannot ſuffer the Paſſion he has for her; he muſt renounce it, or never ſee me more, I'le rather from this preſent deprive my ſelf of the pleaſure of ſeeing him, without asking him any thing,</hi> continued ſhe; <hi>and likewiſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57998:20"/>the ſacrifice that I pretend from him would oblige me to too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. Ah! what would my Father ſay, if I ſhould engage my ſelf without his Conſent: Alas! perhaps he has already diſcovered my trouble, and perhaps he attributes to Jealouſie the diſorder I have made appear.</hi> This fear for ſome time ſuſpended the violence of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and made her at length take the reſolution of concealing her grief from the Eyes even of thoſe who cauſed it.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d' Avero</hi> rely'd much upon the merit of his Daughter, and hoped to ſee her one day Queen of <hi>Portugal.</hi> She likewiſe conceived great hopes of her Charms; and both in concert, without imparting to one another their Deſigns, laid Ambuſhes for the liberty of a Prince, who came and caſt himſelf into Chains. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> diſtinguiſhed <hi>Elvira</hi> from all thoſe that endeavoured to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57998:20"/>pleaſe him: He paid her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little paſſionate addreſſes, that are never offer'd but to one Perſon, and are the forerunners of the tendereſt Paſſion. <hi>Elvira</hi>'s heart was too ſenſible, and her Soul too ambitious not to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſtinctions and the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a Prince, ſo gallant, ſo well made, and ſo lovely as <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> but how prone ſoever he was for Love, his domineering Paſſion was Glory: He impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered the prudent Zeal of Cardinal <hi>Henry,</hi> who oppoſed the boyling ardour with which he ſought out dangers; he often ſtole from the vigilance of his Guards, and quitted the company of Ladies and tender Converſations, to go en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the moſt Savage Beaſts in the midſt of the Foreſt. He paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loved Hunting, the more dangerous it was the more Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſeemed to him. And as Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57998:21"/>did with all their power mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the violence of that Exerciſe, and the ardour which he gave himſelf up to it, they got the Ladies of the Court to be often of the Parties, and endeavoured to make a Diverſion of ſo rude and ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an amuſement. He was one day at Queen <hi>Katherine</hi>'s, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Match to go hunt Lions the next day. The Queen, whom this Propoſition had cauſed to tremble, and who knew very well that directly to oppoſe this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Deſigns, would but ſo much the more irritate his deſires, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly made uſe of the Power ſhe ſaw <hi>Elvira</hi> had over the King, and told him gently; <hi>The only name of Lions has made</hi> Elvira <hi>tremble, my Son, and I believe if you hunt them to morrow, you will have but few Ladies in your train: I love hunting paſſionately,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Elvira,</hi> having penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queens Deſign; <hi>but the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57998:21"/>truth is, this Chace ſeems to me too terrible, and there are much gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, wherein I made the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of my ſolitude conſiſt. Well then, we will run a Stag to morrow,</hi> anſwered the King haſtily, <hi>the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be of the party, and you will be there Madam,</hi> purſued he, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderly on <hi>Elvira?</hi> The Queen had a great deal of joy, ſhe had made her Son change his deſign: <hi>Elvira</hi> was much pleaſed ſhe had ſerved the Queens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhe had received this mark of Complaiſance from <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi> who was preſent at this Converſation, could not ſee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing for ſpight, this ſlight proof of the Kings tenderneſs for another than her ſelf; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one retired ſome moments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give Orders for all that was neceſſary for that Match.</p>

                  <p>The King ſent one to tell the Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> the next day, that as <hi>Elvira</hi> had not perhaps had time to prepare her Hunting Clotths, he prayed him to give her thoſe he ſent her; which was a <hi>Juſticore</hi> covered with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Point of Gold and Silver; the Flowers of which were raiſed to the life with Jewels of ſeveral Colours; a Riding Petticoate of the ſame Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Cap loaded with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of long and very beautiful Blew Feathers: The Duke accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Preſent for his Daughter with a great deal of reſpect, and went immediately to <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where having found her ſtill in Bed, he told her, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed all her Women to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: <hi>My Daughter, I bring you a Hunting Habit, which the King has Commanded me to give you.</hi> This Preſent and Meſſage deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Father, could not but cauſe much trouble in her, who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57998:22"/>received them. <hi>Elvira</hi> appeared at it amazed and confuſed, and not knowing how to anſwer the Duke, ſhe told him with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice: <hi>I am very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized my Lord, at the Preſent the King makes me, and ſtill more, that you your ſelf would take the care to offer it me. It would however have more perplexed me, had it been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me by any other,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>and as I have neither Rank nor Merit that can draw the Cares of this King—No my Daughter,</hi> interrupted the Duke, <hi>I know,</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>diſtinguiſhes you from all thoſe that are at Court: You are young, he is ſenſible, and nothing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes me of all that I have ſeen from him in your favour; it might alarum a more ſevere Virtue than mine, but I think I know you, and I know the Court. All I deſire of you at preſent,</hi> continued he, <hi>is, that you would without repugnance and diſſimulation diſcover to me, all that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57998:23"/>ſhall paſs of moſt importance, in the Commerce</hi> Don Sbaſtian <hi>would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you in. You have no longer a Mother, my Daughter,</hi> purſued he, with an affectionate and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accent, <hi>perhaps being both of the ſame Sex, you would have been more bold and eaſie to have diſcovered to her what you thought upon this Subject, and her Prudence would without doubt have aided you, to conduct your ſelf in an Affair of this importance. You have given tears enough to her death,</hi> ſeeing ſhe began to weep, <hi>you muſt at preſent reunite in me alone, all the confidence and tenderneſs you had both for her and me, and you muſt ſpeak to me with the ſame frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you would have done to her, to the end, my Counſels may ſupply the want of her, and we may take juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in all that concerns you. My Lord,</hi> anſwered <hi>Elvira,</hi> penetrated with grief and confuſion, <hi>I have for you, as much ſincerity and reſpect as I ever had for my Mother, whom
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57998:23"/>I cannot too much lament: But I dare aſſure you, without being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what I owe you, that as</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>has never acquainted me, he had an inclination for me, I have never yet conſulted my ſelf in what concerns him. I do not ask you what paſſes in your heart,</hi> (ſaid the Duke) <hi>I could not preſcribe you other Rules than thoſe your Duty dictates to you; you know them all, and I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you will ever follow them: My Honour, your Reputation, the Memory of your Mother, and your own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have too much power over your Spirit, to let your ſelf be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Paſſion that is contrary to them. I will only know from you,</hi> continued he, <hi>if you have not any averſion for the King, and if you find in your ſelf ambition enough to deſire to become one day Queen of</hi> Portugal. <hi>This deſign I know is ſomething raſh, and it would be even extravagance to let it appear in the Eyes of all the World, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57998:24"/>it cannot be dangerous; and provided you have but greatneſs of Soul enough to form the Project, and purſue it with Care and Caution, I do not deſpair of ſucceſs. My Lord,</hi> anſwered <hi>Elvira,</hi> whom theſe laſt Words had animated with hopes, <hi>if I muſt ſpeak to you with all the Confidence you deſire of me, I confeſs to you, that the Courtſhip of a King ſo well formed, ſo young, and ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant as ours is, cannot diſpleaſe a Perſon, who is not prepoſſeſſed, and that not being foreſtalled with any Sentiment to his diſadvantage, the Crown of</hi> Portugal <hi>would ſeem full of Charms to me, if I ſaw the leaſt likelyhood of pretending to it. Ah! my Daughter,</hi> reply'd the Duke with joy in embracing her, <hi>theſe are the ſentiments I would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired you withal: Purſue this great Work with all the Conduct, and all the Perſeverance you are capable of; but fill all your heart with that Noble Ambition, for fear ſome other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57998:24"/>Paſſion ſhould ſeize it, and not leave you all the freedom, that is neceſſary for this Project.</hi> He gave her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Counſels for her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: <hi>Elvira</hi> promiſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it always according to his wiſhes, after which the Duke went out of her Chamber, and left her to think at liberty of all ſhe had been newly acquainted with, and of the Dreſſes that were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for her in the Hunting-Match, of which ſhe might apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Honours.</p>
                  <p>The hour for Hunting being come, every one went to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz: The moſt part of the Ladies were dreſſed like <hi>Amazons,</hi> and mounted upon very fine Horſes: But <hi>Elvira</hi> appeared Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in her Dreſs, the King hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew again the Habit he had ſent her, ſo much luſtre it had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her; her Hair was ty'd back in great Buckles round her Cap; and this Dreſs gave her a lively
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57998:25"/>and penetrating Air, which ſhe had not ordinarily. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſaid to her a thouſand fine things upon her Beauty, and ſhe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented him upon his Preſent. All the Ladies had their Knights near them; and there was only <hi>Leonora,</hi> who ever avoided the Duke <hi>de Barcellos;</hi> and this Troop dividing it ſelf into Couples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being too particular, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lovers with favourable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſpeaking to them of their Paſſion. <hi>Elvira,</hi> Riding better than any of her Sex, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went them all, and was almoſt ever up with the Dogs; the King, being Charmed with her Grace and her Addreſs, ever accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and being come with her far enough from the reſt, to a Pond, which the Stag they Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leapt into. <hi>Your Preſence has brought this Stag to the laſt gaſp, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>there is no Liberty but what yields to you; I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57998:25"/>have not been able to defend mine a gainſt you,</hi> purſued he tenderly, <hi>and I ſhall not regret it, if I can but hope to pleaſe you.</hi> How bold ſoever <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> naturally was, he could not pronounce theſe words with his uſual reſolution, he felt that inſtant ſuch fear as a whole Army would not have been capable of giving him; and <hi>Elvira,</hi> who had expected ſuch a kind of Declaration, did not fail to affect the ſurprize and baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſuch an avowal might cauſe in a Perſon leſs witty and leſs prepared than her ſelf. <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> (for thus are the Kings of that Nation ſtiled) ſaid ſhe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57998:26"/>your Diſcourſes have almoſt made me forget that you are a great Monarch, and I am your Subject. No, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> with all the tranſport the heat of his Temper and Paſſion was capable of, <hi>I love you, I adore you, my Eyes have told it you; my Sighs have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it you; my aſſiduities ſhall confirm it: I know not whether I am King or Subject when with you; and you alone can render me happy. Wherefore tell me in the Name of Heaven,</hi> purſu'd he, <hi>what I ought to hope or fear, and do not make me languiſh in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. Elvira</hi> doubtful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, had, during this Diſcourſe, her Eyes upon the ground, her Carriage uncertain, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance languiſhing; and as ſhe was ſometime without anſwering, the King prepared himſelf to tell her ſtill ſomething more preſſing, when the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of this Converſation, ſpitefully run to them, and could
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57998:26"/>not forbear interrupting them, notwithſtanding all the meaſures ſhe had reſolved to keep in regard of thoſe Lovers: <hi>Elvira</hi> ran mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to her; but however made <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſee in her Eyes, in quitting him, a languiſhing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that, without explaining too much, gave him great hopes.</p>
                  <p>After the Troop was come to the death of the Stag, they return'd to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where <hi>Cardinal Henry</hi> came to ſhew the king Letters that he had newly received from <hi>Spain</hi> in the Packet of <hi>Souza,</hi> by which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> let him know, that <hi>Millei Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc,</hi> Brother of the lately deceaſed King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> was come into <hi>Spain</hi> to demand Succours of him, which he had not thought fit to grant him; neither did he think, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ought to grant it him, becauſe the Pretentions of <hi>Moluc</hi> were too oppoſite to the Laws of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and it would be but to perplex themſelves in a War,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57998:27"/>that could not be advantageous on their ſide, <hi>Moluc</hi> having neither Troops nor Money to Execute ſo great an Enterpriſe. But the King, impatiently longing to ſignalize himſelf, and having his Mind only filled with Wars and Conqueſts, told the Cardinal his Uncle, <hi>That the Succours he ſhould give to</hi> Moluc, <hi>might be advantageous to the Crown of</hi> Portugal; <hi>that the</hi> Moors <hi>would deſtroy themſelves in that War; that in Succouring that Prince, they might weaken the ſtrongeſt without ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the weakeſt: And at leng than thoſe Quarrels, he ſhould not fail to gain ſome Cities or Places, which they might joyn to thoſe that</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>already had in</hi> Africa. The Cardinal, who ſaw with delight the Warlike Ardour of this young King, but could have wiſh'd to have ſomething moderated its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, anſwered him: <hi>Before you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termide your ſelf for this War, Sir, it is convenient you be perfectly well
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57998:27"/>acquainted with the Subject of the Quarrel betwixt thoſe two Kings: And for the Explaining to you their different Pretentions, I muſt be a little more particular in their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and tell you things that no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has yet been offered to diſcover to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Kingdoms of</hi> Fez, Morocco, <hi>and</hi> Turedant, (purſued he, ſeeing the King gave Ear attentively to him) <hi>have ever been governed by two different Kings, till</hi> Mulei Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met-Cherif <hi>poſſeſſing, together with his Brother</hi> Mulei Hamet, <hi>thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Kingdoms, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite them under his Power: Theſe two Kings then made a Law, by which they ordered, that Brother ſhould ſucceed Brother, and ſhould thus Reign after one another, to the excluſion of the deceaſed Kings Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Some time after, one of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humets <hi>Sons called</hi> Abdala, <hi>ſeeing this Law oppoſed his Ambition, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral of his Brothers and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57998:28"/>to be killed and ſtrangled, under divers pretexts of intereſt of State; at laſt he ſucceeded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had the moſt happy and peaceable Reign that the</hi> Cherifs <hi>had ever enjoy'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though</hi> Abdala <hi>had Policy and Cruelty enough, to commit all the Crimes that ſhould ſeem advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, he did not cauſe all his Brothers Throats to be cut at his coming to the Throne; he let three of thoſe unfortunate perſons live, who by reaſon they were very young, did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him formidable enough for him to take care to diſpatch them. Theſe weak Children feared his Fury, as ſoon as they were capable of reaſon. Two of them took Refuge with the</hi> Grand Seignior, <hi>to avoid the death that threatned them; and the third fled to the</hi> Arabians, <hi>where he died ſome years after.</hi> Abdala <hi>having Reigned peaceably the ſpace of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, and finding himſelf decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, delivered his Kingdom into the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57998:28"/>Hands of his Eldeſt Son, called</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet, <hi>and cauſed him to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King through all his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, notwithſtanding the Law of the</hi> Cherifs, <hi>which was contrary to that Election.</hi> Abdala <hi>died in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after, and left a Daughter very young, called</hi> Almeida, <hi>whom he cauſed to be brought up in</hi> Spain, <hi>and whoſe blooming Beauty began to make great noiſe in that Court, when ſhe departed from it to retire to her Brother</hi> Mahumet: <hi>But as this new King feared at his coming to the Crown, that thoſe two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles, who had took Refuge in</hi> Turky, <hi>for the avoiding his Fathers fury, would come, grounded upon the Laws of their Anceſtors, and diſpute the Kingdom with him: He ſent a</hi> Moor <hi>to</hi> Tremiſena, <hi>to Aſſaſſinate the eldeſt, who was retired thither. It is but two years ſince this Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was committed, with all the Rage and Succeſs, that</hi> Mahumet <hi>had wiſhed, and only one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57998:29"/>at preſent of thoſe three Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is this</hi> Mulei Moluc, <hi>whom the King of</hi> Spain <hi>makes mention of to us in theſe Letters: He has given marks of a great Valour amongſt the</hi> Ottomans, <hi>where he had taken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. He has Signalized himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the League which the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans lately made, to fight the</hi> Turks: <hi>He has done a thouſand Actions worthy of an Eternal Memory, in the late engagement of thoſe two Fleets, and when</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> V. <hi>took</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, <hi>he was almoſt the only one, who reſiſted him with vigour; but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf too near</hi> Mahumet <hi>in that Country, where he had not any Troops, and fearing ſuch a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that which had deprived his laſt Brother of his life, he left</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, <hi>where he then reſided, to come into</hi> Spain, <hi>and implore the Succours of</hi> Philip, <hi>imagining, though a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and a Vagabond, without Forces, and without Money, he could by his Vallour alone recover the Kingdomes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57998:29"/>belonging to him by their Laws, and Conquer</hi> Mahumet <hi>his Nephew, who is ſettled upon the Throne, beloved by his Subjects, fortified in his Cities, and maintained by a powerful Army. Thus,</hi> purſued <hi>Cardinal Henry, your Highneſs ſees clearly, how King</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <hi>had reaſon to refuſe Succour to</hi> Moluc, <hi>and how to ſecond his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign's would be to maintain a Law, contrary to ours, and to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who is Naturally Heir of the Crown.</hi> Theſe and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like reaſons diſſuaded <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſtion</hi> from aiding <hi>Moluc:</hi> He judged after ſome Reflexion, that this <hi>African</hi> would not come to demand Succours in <hi>Portugal,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been refuſed by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being acquainted with the ſtrict Engagements of thoſe two Kings. Theſe Politick Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations did not ſo take up the Kings Mind, but that he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome thoughts upon his Love. If the Declaration he had made of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57998:30"/>it, gave ſome eaſe to the violence of his Paſſion, the vexation of not having been able to get from <hi>Elvira</hi> any favourable Anſwer, made him paſs very troubleſome Moments: He ſometimes Figured to himſelf, that he could never be beloved by her: The Langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and the Tenderneſs which <hi>Elvira</hi> made appear to him in her Eyes when ſhe left him, could not reaſſure him againſt this fear; but he was not long in his Suſpicions, and he had all manner of reaſon to believe in the Converſations he had afterwards with <hi>Elvira,</hi> that ſhe had no averſion for him. She even aſſured him in ſeveral Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters that ſhe could ſuffer that Paſſion with joy, provided it might ſute with her Duty, and told him all theſe things with all the ſweetneſs and complaiſance, that though ſhe cunningly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſelf to her Father, as to all the ſentiments of her heart, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57998:30"/>King conceived hopes that he ſhould be beloved, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flattered himſelf with having ſome part in her tenderneſs, their Commerce became at length ſo great and ſo manifeſt, that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> ſeeing ſhe could not break it, feigned to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it, and fancied, that introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her ſelf to thoſe two Lovers, by the Title of a Confident, ſhe might on ſome occaſions of falling out, or inconſtancy, recover her favour with the King, rather than by the Jealouſie ſhe might make appear. She quitted the Deſign ſhe had taken of Engaging her Son in an Intreague with <hi>Elvira,</hi> rightly judging, that in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture things were, this enterpriſe would be more diſadvantageous than profitable to her Projects. And the young Duke having never had any inclination but for <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and ſeeing himſelf treated with more rigour than uſnally, without
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57998:31"/>having yet penetrated into the Cauſe of it, endeavoured to clear this point with her. He ſaw her all alone; Vexation did in her, what all his Tenderneſs had not been able yet to do, and Jealouſie made known to the Duke the love ſhe had for him. He firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of her, and then comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with a great deal of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all that unlucky juncture had made her ſuffer, and gave her a thouſand aſſurances of fidelity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſuſpicions.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Lovers enjoy'd, with Tranquility enough, during ſome time, the pleaſures of their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But how accompliſhed ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was, he was not born to be happy, and the moſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Man of the Court was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent cauſe of theſe firſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The <hi>Count de Souza</hi> having worthily acquitted himſelf of his Embaſſy, abandoned the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> loaded with Glory and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57998:31"/>Preſents. The News of his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy return was immediately ſpread about <hi>Lisbon.</hi> As he had a great deal of Merit, and a great many Friends, he was only heard ſpoken of in all Companies; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations were almoſt all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his Praiſes. <hi>Elvira</hi> heard his fine Qualities cry'd up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places: She had never ſeen him, and conceived a great deſire to know him. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had a very fine Country Houſe, two Leagues from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lordſhip that belonged to <hi>Souza,</hi> whither he often carried <hi>Violanta</hi> and her Friends. <hi>Elvira</hi> was one of her moſt intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them there one day, after the Ball was begun, four Perſons were ſeen to enter diſguiſed like Slaves, who drew the Eyes of all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, by the Magnificence of their habit. But one among 'em charmed all People by his Air and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57998:32"/>his manners; they took him at firſt for <hi>Don Henry,</hi> becauſe <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> having never had any great kindneſs for <hi>Violanta,</hi> they were not of that Aſſembly, and could only come in Maſquerade; but they afterwards obſerv'd, that <hi>Don Henry</hi> was much fatter, and of a leſs advantageous ſhape than this Slave. He at firſt placed himſelf at <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Feet, and told her with the beſt Grace imaginable, that he came from the fartheſt part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> to have the honour of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Chains: She anſwered him very Obligingly. And by the diſcourſe ſhe had with him, ſhe eaſily obſerved, that this Slave had as much Wit as he had a good Meen. <hi>Violanta</hi> took him out to dance, and he acquitted himſelf in the moſt ſeemly and pleaſing way that can be fancied. He took out <hi>Elvira,</hi> who danced better with him than ſhe had done before. None knew him, and they all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57998:32"/>longed to ſee his Maſque off. At length <hi>Elvira</hi> ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begged it of him, that he was conſtrained to retire apart, and ſhew her his Face. She was much ſurpriz'd, ſhe did not know him, but much more at his Luſtre. <hi>Ah! ſince I do not know you,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, (being ſomewhat recovered out of her aſtoniſhment) <hi>and you are ſo well formed, you muſt be the Count</hi> de Souza? <hi>I beg you would not name me, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her; <hi>I am unwilling to be known; I had a deſire to paſs this night at my Country-Houſe, and have not been yet at Court. Elvira</hi> promiſed ſhe would not diſcover him, and kept her Word. As no body knew, that the <hi>Count de Souza</hi> was Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his Houſe, none of them ſuſpected any thing of the truth. He made his Court to her during the Ball, as to the Miſtreſs of his King; whoſe favour he ought to manage. She hearkned to him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57998:33"/>with a delight that cauſed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in her, and found a ſecret Charm in his Words and Actions. The Ball being ended, <hi>Elvira</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Lisbon</hi> with a numerous Train of Coaches, and <hi>Souza</hi> came ſeveral times into her mind in the Night, under the moſt agreeable <hi>Idea</hi> that can ever be formed of an accompliſh'd Man.</p>
                  <p>He appeared the next day at Court, and went to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Commiſſion to the King, who was with <hi>Elvira.</hi> She could not forbear bluſhing at the ſight of him; ſhe found him yet more charming than he had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her; but ſhe ſo well knew how to conceal her Bluſhes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, that no body perceived 'em. They diſcourſed of the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Count de Souza,</hi> of whom they asked the News of it, <hi>ſaid,</hi> that <hi>Don John,</hi> Natural Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the V. was lately Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, and appeared in great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57998:33"/>Splendour; that he was a Prince equally underſtanding in War and in Policy; that he had ſhewn him a great deal of kindneſs, and had a particular Eſteem of his Merit: That King <hi>Philip,</hi> who had been three times a Widdower, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Marry <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Niece, and Siſter of <hi>Maximilian</hi> II. and that <hi>Katherine Michela,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Philip</hi> and the late Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Queen, was one of the moſt Beautiful Perſons of <hi>Europe.</hi> He was going to tell ſeveral other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars more of that Court; but <hi>Don Henry,</hi> entring in that moment, cauſed him ſo much trouble, that he could not continue his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe: He received his kindneſſes with the greateſt Civility, having reſolved to avoid as much as he could the meeting with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and his Rival; and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> would ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to ſee <hi>Elvira,</hi> he took leave of the King, and retired to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57998:34"/>his Houſe, where he employ'd all the Efforts of his Reaſon to ſtifle a Paſſion, that he perceived was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to revive, notwithſtanding all the Cares he had taken to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Elvira</hi> no longer gave her thoughts up to Greatneſs, and was not ſo much dazled with the Crown of <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> but that ſhe conſidered of the merit of the <hi>Count de Souza</hi> with much admiration. Her Heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged it ſelf by degrees in ſeeing him; and Love evermore uſurping ſomewhat upon Ambition; ſhe begun to have more deſire to pleaſe the Count, than care to engage the King. She ſaw <hi>Souza</hi> every day, and always diſcovered in him ſome new Quality, capable of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: She found that he did the moſt indifferent thing, with a moſt particular Charm. Not any Man about the Court appeared to her ſo well Made, ſo Active, or ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57998:34"/>Witty as he; the greateſt Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements tired her, when he was not there; and the inclination ſhe was ſenſible of at firſt for him, in a ſhort time, augmented after ſuch a manner, that it became at length a moſt violent Paſſion. It is true, that the Aſſiduities and Complaiſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which this Count rendred her, contributed very much to the Violence of her Love. As he no longer made Viſits to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and had reſolved to apply himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the cares of his Fortune, <hi>Elvira</hi> had with joy obſerved, that ſhe was the Perſon of all the Court, whom he ofteneſt Viſited; ſhe took for amorous Addreſſes, the Devoirs he rendred her as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of his King, and ſo ardently deſired to be beloved by him, that ſhe eaſily imagined he had a love for her.</p>
                  <p>There appeared ſo much affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Complaiſances ſhe had for <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57998:35"/>his tender reſpects with ſo great a Conſtraint, that the King quickly perceived he was not beloved; and as he loved with all the fervency that a firſt Paſſion can be capable of, theſe coldneſſes did very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aggrieve him. Sometimes he openly complained; and walking one day with her, and thoſe that were the Companions of his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in the Gardens of <hi>Don Lewis:</hi> After having propoſed to her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Divertiſements, none of which ſhe would accept of, he reproached her for the indifference ſhe ſeemed to be in to Pleaſures. She defended her ſelf, and told him, there were a thouſand Recreations capable of diverting her: <hi>They are thoſe then that I have no part in,</hi> ſaid the King to her, <hi>and I do not believe, that of a long time any of thoſe has pleaſed you, which I have propoſed? Elvira</hi> could not hold from bluſhing at theſe Words, and <hi>Violanta,</hi> who loved her tenderly,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57998:35"/>perceiving her diſorder, and the King's vexation, told him, for to make up the buſineſs: <hi>Ah! Sir, it is impoſſible to be more gay than</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira <hi>was at the Ball, you gave two days ago:</hi> (And in truth ſhe was in a very good humour in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; becauſe the King had Commanded <hi>Souza</hi> to do the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of it) <hi>I muſt confeſs,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, that</hi> Elvira <hi>found the Ball ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Charming: I remember that at a Regal, which</hi> Don Lewis <hi>gave to the Ladies, ſometime ſince, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the merrieſt of the Company; I remember too,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Lewis, and I believe the four</hi> Moors, <hi>who came to be her Slaves, had put her into that humour.</hi> Theſe laſt Words put <hi>Elvira</hi> ſo out of Countenance, that ſhe would never have been able to have concealed her trouble, if ſhe had not luckily made a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which gave a pretext to this diſorder. The King after having lent her his Hand to hold her up,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57998:36"/>enquired very earneſtly who thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> were; the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> Arrived when the King asked this Queſtion. He himſelf was ſtruck dumb, and the ſight of him redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Elvira's</hi> diſorder, they were both of them in an equal pain; though they had different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and this trouble would without doubt have diſcovered <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi>'s ſecret Paſſion, if <hi>Cardinal Henry,</hi> whom <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſtill conſidered as his Tutour, had not arrived at that inſtant, and broke off that Converſation by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The King going to Supper preſently after, the Ladies retired; and as <hi>Souza</hi> had perceived he was the cauſe of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s trouble, he very prudently avoided any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Converſation with her, and pretended he was obliged to be at the Kings Supper, that he might be diſpenſed from leading <hi>Elvira</hi> as he was uſed to do. But what Addreſs and Care ſoever he employ'd to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57998:36"/>avoid the aſſurance of a thing, which his Zeal and Modeſty ever refuſed, it was impoſſible for him to be long in ſuſpence of what he feared. <hi>Elvira</hi> loved him with too much Paſſion, to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her ſelf: When ſhe ever talked with him, ſhe was ſtrangely diſordered; ſhe was even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo bold, as to let him know how much the Kings Cares and Complaiſances fatigued her, and what a torture it was to her, that ſhe could not follow her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with an entire Liberty; ſhe began ſeveral times to talk to him of the diſorder the <hi>Moors</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation put her in; the Count came always off from theſe perplexities with a great deal of Prudence and Civility; but at length <hi>Elvira</hi> fan. cying to her ſelf, that he had ſome affection for her and that reſpect hindred him from telling it, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was her part to encourage him. She reſolved one day in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57998:37"/>the violence of her Paſſion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to him openly, what ſhe was ſenſible of; but the occaſion could not eaſily be found, becauſe the Count carefully avoided her, and ſaw her but at the Kings, whither he could not diſpenſe himſelf from going.</p>
                  <p>A light indiſpoſition had detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Prince in Bed that day, <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi> was to ſee him, the Dorekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers told her, he was aſleep; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe ſtepped into the Anticham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and perceived near the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Count <hi>Souza,</hi> in all likely hood expecting <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>'s waking, and ſeemed to be profoundly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: She approached him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and as they were far enough off from thoſe, who were preſent, as not to be underſtood: <hi>May I ask you, what you think of at preſent, Count,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him all amazed? <hi>Souza</hi> being ſurpriz'd at her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, would have retired after ſome Civilities: <hi>No, no, ſtay,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57998:37"/>ſhe to him, ſtopping him, <hi>I will Diſcourſe you about ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you; I participate too much in all that touches you, to leave you in the trouble I have ſeen you in for ſome time: Do you love, are you ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>my Credit may equally ſerve you in thoſe two things, and I offer it you all entire, if you will tell me, what it is that makes you ſad.</hi> The Count <hi>de Souza</hi> was much out of Countenance to hear this Diſcourſe, and told her, after having thanked her for her Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he had no other ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than that of maintaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Court, in the rank his Birth had placed him: <hi>You are then in Love,</hi> reply'd ſhe immediately, with an extream diſorder. <hi>I aſſure you, Madam,</hi> interrupted <hi>Souza</hi> gently, <hi>I Love only my King. A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is not incompatible with a great deal of Zeal,</hi> reply'd <hi>Elvira</hi> tenderly. <hi>A Heart all entire is not too much for ſo great a Prince,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57998:38"/>he firmly, <hi>we owe him all our thoughts; and I make it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and am proud of Conſecrating to him even the very leaſt of my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> This Diſcourſe ſo diſcouraged <hi>Elvira,</hi> and put her ſo out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that ſhe could no longer bear the looks of <hi>Souza,</hi> nor reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing to him, and ſhe knew not whether ſhe had beſt quit him, or ſtay with him, when the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers came and told her, that the King was awake, and that they might ſee him: They went both into his Chamber, the Court grew full in a little time, and <hi>Souza</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red preſently after, more troubled at what he had newly heard, than he had been in all his life time.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> obſerving all his Daughters Actions, and ſeeing the ſequel did not anſwer the happy beginning, ſuſpected, that ſome ſtronger Paſſion triumphed over <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi>'s Ambition. She had talked to him ſo often, and with ſo much
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57998:38"/>admiration of <hi>Souza,</hi> and this Count appeared to him ſo proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire love, that he Examined them both with Care; he ſaw, <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi> bluſht, and was ever troubled at the ſight of him. He no longer doubted, but he was the cauſe of this change, and reſolved to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it without ſeeming to be the leaſt concerned. The Count <hi>de Souza</hi> was of a Rank, Merit, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, not to be eaſily ruined at Court: Wherefore the Duke em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Cares and his Credit to remove him after another manner. An Ambaſſadour was to be ſent to <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the V, who was newly raiſed to the Pontificate by the Cares and Solicitations of the Great <hi>Boromeus,</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Farneſe.</hi> The Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> took ſuch a courſe, as that the King caſt his Eyes upon the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> for that Embaſſy: But ſo ſoon as <hi>Elvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> had learnt this News, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of ceaſing to ſee what ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57998:39"/>could not forbear loving, made ſuch an impreſſion upon her Mind, that ſhe went with all haſte to the King, pretending to be ignorant of what he had reſolved, to pray him with earneſtneſs to give that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Don Alvaro Caſtro,</hi> whom all the Court knew to be one of her Creatures; and the King having told her, he had granted that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to the Count <hi>d'Souza</hi> at the Duke <hi>de Avero</hi>'s deſire, the fear ſhe was in that her Father had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her Paſſion, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was deſirous to remove him from Court, made her ſo dumb and out of Countenance, that ſhe almoſt ſuffered all which paſſed in her Heart to be read in her Eyes; but after being come ſomewhat to her ſelf again, ſhe ſpoke with ſo tender and preſſing an Air to <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> that not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her any thing, he told the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> in the Evening, who came to thank him, that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57998:39"/>had judged it more convenient to give that Commiſſion to <hi>Don Alvaro Caſtro,</hi> who had already one of the ſame Nature, and was perfectly well inſtructed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Change ſurprized all the Court: They ſought for the reaſon of it, and it was found, that <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Credit was the cauſe. Her Father did not doubt of her Paſſion: He make her a thouſand reproaches, which did no good at all. <hi>Alvaro Caſtro</hi> departed, after having thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her for a favour, he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to her goodneſs for; and the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> knew with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream grief, that 'twas as great a misfortune to him to be beloved by the perſon he did not love, as to be hated by her he loved.</p>
                  <p>The King daily perceiving more and more indifference in <hi>Elvira,</hi> was ſo mortally grieved at it, that it rendred him the moſt unhappy of all Men, though he ſeemed the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57998:40"/>moſt happy. And that which ſtill augmented his trouble was, that at that time aroſe one called <hi>Peter Bertrand,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Montluc,</hi> not being willing to ſteep his Hands in the Blood of <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> not to be on either ſide in the Civil Wars and Hereſies that ſo Plagued all <hi>France;</hi> fitted out a little Fleet, and Manned it with about Twelve hundred Men, or thereabouts: His youngeſt Son, and another younger Brother of the Family of <hi>Pompadour</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in this Voyage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come upon the Coaſts of <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> they would have Landed to have taken in freſh Water; but the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were Maſters of that Iſland, Fired their Canon upon them, and Sallied out againſt <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand.</hi> He immedietely ſet Eight hundred of his Men on Shore, Cut the <hi>Portugals</hi> to pieces, Sack'd the City that bears the Name of the Iſland, and died a little after, of a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57998:40"/>wound he received in that Fight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could not hear this News without a great deal of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he cauſed ſatisfaction to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Bertrand</hi> and his Companions of being Pyrates and Infractours of the Treaties. <hi>France</hi> having then Inteſtine Enemies enough, without needing to draw upon it others, was willing to Sacrifice to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s anger, all thoſe who had followed <hi>Bertrand</hi> in that Voyage; but the reputation of <hi>Montluc,</hi> and the Power of the Admiral, who ever maintained the Glory of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, fenced off this blow by his Subtilty. The Count <hi>de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zay</hi> was ſent to <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> to juſtifie the <hi>French-men,</hi> and Queen <hi>Margarite,</hi> who was ever contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Great Deſigns, took that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to attempt a Match between <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and the Siſter of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, to the intent this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance might the more cloſely unite
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57998:41"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and might augment the Rights, that the <hi>French</hi> pretend to have upon that Crown. The Count <hi>de Sanzay</hi> departed with ſecret Inſtructions for that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. He juſtified <hi>Bertrand</hi> and his Companions; and knowing that pleaſures are often very good means to ſucceed in Affairs, he was at all the Divertiſements of the Court, to the intent he might the more eaſily bring to paſs his ſecret Negotiation. He was young and well made, which was ſufficient to get into the favour of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ladies. His Diſcourſes and his Manners had a certain agreeableneſs, that had the Art of Charming even in the beſt of things; that free and eaſie Air that makes Gentleman be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others, was more Natural to him than to any Man beſides; he was of that ſort of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant humour, which ever engages it ſelf in Love, but is ever for all manner of Divertiſements: But
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57998:41"/>his Wit was yet more Solid than Gallant, and he oftentimes made thoſe Trifles be uſeful to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Affairs. <hi>Leonora</hi> ſeem'd to him worthy of his Cares, and fit for ſome little Engagements; ſhe had an Air of Sweetneſs and Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which made one not afraid of thoſe Artifices in her, which her Sex commonly makes uſe of: The Count <hi>de Sanzay,</hi> entertained her with a thouſand Gallantries. He gave her Treats and Diverſions nearly contrived; he ſpoke to her of Love upon all occaſions, but he ſpoke after ſuch a manner, that one could not take ſeriouſly enough ſo as to be diſpleaſed, and however appeared ſo ſincere, that Credit might be given to it, deſigning to give high <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Court of <hi>France</hi> for the facilitating the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which he negotiated: All that he did for <hi>Leonora</hi> was ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, that the Duke of <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi>'s affection was alarm'd, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57998:42"/>he was ſometimes very uneaſie.</p>
                  <p>He immediately found that <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi> had great Power over the King; he endeavoured to make her his Friend, and though he judged, that the Ambition of the Duke <hi>d'Avero,</hi> and the tender Commerce of his Daughter, with <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> would bring great Obſtacles to his Negotiation, he perſuaded himſelf that they would ſoon pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into his Deſigns, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could know them, he might have perhaps brought them to paſs. He fancied he might draw great light from her for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Projects: He forgot none of all thoſe little Cares, that might procure him ſome part in her Friendſhip. She could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it him; ſhe took delight in ſeeing him, ſhe ſpoke to him with Confidence, ſhe often enquired of him News of his Amour; he did not excuſe himſelf from telling her, hoping that the Confidence he put
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57998:42"/>in her, would obtain the like, and others from her, that might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his enterprize; but perſons for Wit are too reſerv'd in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſhe would ſooner have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the moſt ſecret Affairs of State, than the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Heart, and all that the Counts penetration could diſcover in that Intreague, was, that <hi>Elvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> had no great inclination for the King, but that he had a violent Paſſion for her. He ſpoke imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of this Marriage unto Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> becauſe he ſaw her well intentioned enough for <hi>France,</hi> ſhe aſſured him, ſhe would endeavour it with all her Power: But as ſhe no longer concerned her ſelf hardly at all with Affairs of State, ſhe was no great help to him. He likewiſe managed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Henry</hi> with great Care: He perceived, that this Prelate did not approve of the Paſſion which <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had for <hi>Elvira,</hi> and that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57998:43"/>it was not his meaning to Contract a New Alliance with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He ſpoke to him very ſlightly of that which <hi>Portugal</hi> might make with <hi>France:</hi> But whether this Cardinal was not willing to procure Heirs to the Crown, that devolved upon him after <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>'s Death, or not any of thoſe Matches did pleaſe him, he found difficulties every where, and the Count <hi>de Sanzay</hi> did not think fit to Diſcourſe him any more about it.</p>
                  <p>He turned all his Deſigns upon the King: He praiſed upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the Wit and Beauty of the Ladies of <hi>France;</hi> he ſhewed him all the advantages he might have by making an Alliance with that Crown. He likewiſe cunningly let him ſee the Picture of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Marguerite,</hi> and often deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her to him in all the extent of her Charms: But of what effect are all endeavours againſt a prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Heart, it was in vain he laid
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57998:43"/>in view all the reaſons of Policy, and Charms of Beauty; <hi>Don Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> had only Eyes for <hi>Elvira,</hi> though ſhe rendred him the moſt unhappy of all Men.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> whoſe Jealouſie did continually make ſome diſcovery of her Rivals incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and being alſo one of <hi>Sanzay</hi>'s Friends, was the firſt who made him obſerve, that <hi>Elvira</hi> had a kindneſs for <hi>Souza.</hi> This Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs fearing, that all ſhe could ſay to the King upon this Subject would be ſuſpected, cunningly ſet on Foot a report amidſt the Secret News of the Court, that <hi>Elvira</hi> had a greater Paſſion for another than for the King. But as <hi>Souza</hi> ſaw <hi>Elvira</hi> leſs than any other, the King did not ſuſpect he had any part in that Intrigue, and was not able to diſcover his Rival. Chance at length acquainted him with what not any one about Court durſt have told him, and what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57998:44"/>was ſuſpected but by very few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Elvira</hi> was coming one day to the Queen's, as the Count <hi>de Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was going out; and as he always endeavoured to avoid meeting her, bowing, he would have paſſed by haſtily; but ſhe ſtopped him, and ſaid to him: <hi>Methinks Count, you take a great deal of Care to ſhun me, and I ſhould have been glad, you would have told me, what reaſon you have to do ſo.</hi> The Count, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed at this Diſcourſe, anſwered her with a great deal of reſpect: <hi>Since I have merited your hatred, and you have judged me unworthy of ſerving my King, in the Commiſſion he had given me, I ought to hide my ſelf from all the World. Is that hating you, Count,</hi> replyed ſhe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, <hi>not to be willing you ſhould go from us?</hi> The King came at theſe Words, and they were all three ſo diſcompoſed, that it was impoſſible for any one of them to ſpeak ſo much as one Word: <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57998:44"/>entred the Queens Appartment, where his diſquiet did not permit him to ſtay long. <hi>Elvira</hi> did not make her Viſit. The Count reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Houſe. And the King, who had only heard the laſt Words of that Converſation, impatient to Explain himſelf with <hi>Elvira,</hi> and all on a Fire to make her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Reproaches, went to her Houſe in ſuch a rage as threatned the ruin of <hi>Souza.</hi> But the King's anger could not laſt againſt the feeble Reaſons of <hi>Elvira;</hi> ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, that in the coldeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, ſhe could do no leſs than anſwer the Count to appeaſe his trouble; and ſhe gave ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a Colour to that Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the King went from her with very little ſuſpicion, and a woundrous deal of Love.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Choller being appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all the Lovers of that Court enjoy'd for ſome time a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icious Peace. <hi>Elvira</hi> took care
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57998:45"/>not to give any Jealouſie to the King: <hi>Souza</hi> comported himſelf ſo prudently, that no ſuſpicions could be conceived of his Behaviour. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> ſeeing all her endeavours were in vain, renounced her Deſign, and retired to the Duke her Husband. The Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> being cleared of all Jealouſies by <hi>Leonora,</hi> was ſure of her Affection, and no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd at the Addreſſes of the Count <hi>de Sanzay,</hi> who did not apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very paſſionately to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and <hi>Violanta</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the ſweeteſt pleaſures of Love. <hi>Don Henry</hi> was full of joy to know he was beloved of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> And <hi>Souza</hi>'s Reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo much Maſter of his Love, that his preſence gave not trouble at all to their Pleaſures, and there was only the Duke <hi>d' Avero,</hi> who was ſtill in diſquiet and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57998:45"/>
                  <p>As he had to no purpoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove <hi>Souza</hi> from Court, and his preſence perpetually allarming him, he fancied, that the Count being Married, he ſhould be exempt from all thoſe fears, and ſhould deprive his Daughter of the hopes that entertained her love. He caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Eugenia</hi> for that Deſign. Some light ſuſpicions that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> made appear one day of <hi>Souza,</hi> gave an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to the Duke, of propoſing this Match to the King, which he did not fail to Colour with ſevenal Reaſons of State. This Propoſition was well received by the King, he undertook it with a great deal of heat, and told <hi>Souza</hi> the next day, that ſome important reaſons had made him think of Marrying him to <hi>Eugenia;</hi> that he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, the care of making her Conſent to that Match, and that he ſhould prepare himſelf for it. A Thunderbolt could not have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57998:46"/>aſtoniſhed <hi>Souza</hi> more than this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe did: He made no other anſwer by a low Bow, and a prompt Retreat. The Count <hi>de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zay</hi> being then at the King's, and having heard the Order <hi>Souza</hi> had newly received, made uſe of that occaſion for the fully clearing his ſuſpicions. He went to <hi>Elvira</hi>'s, and told her this News with ſo much art, that ſhe was not able to conceal either her trouble, or her weakneſs. The Count of <hi>Sanzay</hi> took advantage of her diſorder, and pitied her with a great deal of kindneſs. Compaſſion is the ſureſt way to inſinuate ones ſelf into the favour of the unhappy; he preſſed her with ſo much addreſs, and ſo obligingly offered her his Service, for the preventing this Match, that ſhe Ingenuouſly Confeſſed to him the Affection ſhe had for <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za;</hi> he murmered againſt the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Duke <hi>d'Avero;</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled the Conſtancy of <hi>Elvira;</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57998:46"/>and in fine, when he took his leave, he promiſed her to uſe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deliver her out of this perplexity.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Souza</hi> was returned to his Houſe, he felt a thouſand different motions of Grief and Joy: He at firſt ſuffered himſelf to be lured with the hopes of poſſeſſing <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> which was the greateſt of all happineſſes to him; but making reflexion, that if he obtained her, it would be againſt her Will, he found ſomething ſo culpable and ſo baſe in thoſe hopes, as he laid them by immediately. He ſearch'd into the cauſe of that Propoſition; he ſaw, that to Marry <hi>Eugenia</hi> would be to make himſelf her Tyrant; he foreſaw, that the diſobeying <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> would make all the Court believe he had ſome Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Elvira,</hi> and it would be to expoſe himſelf to all the fury and hatred, that a Jealous and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended King can be capable of.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57998:47"/>But in ſhort, the Count being ever a Compleat Wellbred-Man, choſe rather to be Unhappy than Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and reſolved to loſe rather the favour of his Prince, than to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over his Miſtriſs; he would however ſpeak to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things. He went to her Houſe the next day, where having found her alone, he asked her a moments Audience, without being interrupted, and told her with the moſt Submiſſive and Paſſionate Air Imaginable, <hi>I come to declare to you a ſecret, which I conceal from all the World: For above four years I have lov'd you, Madam, with the pureſt and moſt violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ever was, I have in vain endeavoured to ſtifle this Flame; I went away from</hi> Lisbon; <hi>I depriv'd my ſelf of ſeeing you; I uſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Efforts every day; and all that I have been hitherto able to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf, was, not to let any thing eſcape from this Paſſion that might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57998:47"/>diſpleaſe you: No Madam,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he reſpectfully, <hi>I could not yet have made a Confeſſion of it to you if I were not conſtrained by the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſity that can be imagined. My Lord,</hi> reply'd <hi>Eugenia,</hi> very much ſurpriz'd at a Diſcourſe whoſe end ſhe did not foreſee, <hi>if my Heart was not engag'd—I know it,</hi> Interrupted <hi>Souza,</hi> Don Henry <hi>loves you, and you love him; by my ſighs I never troubled a Commerce, that did not diſpleaſe you; I have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected your choice; I would die a thouſand times rather than Traverſe the Joys of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. However, Madam, however, for reaſons, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you, the King would conſtrain you to Marry me. Ah Count!</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Eugenia</hi> all diſordered, <hi>I cannot perſuade my ſelf, that the King would uſe violence upon any one. I do not believe, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> penetrated with grief, <hi>that you ſuſpect me capable of any Artifice, and what I am ready to do for you,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57998:48"/>well merits, that you had other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: 'Tis the Kings Will, that we Marry one another: Theſe Words ſet you a ſhivering, as they do me a trembling; not but that it would be the greateſt happineſs of my life, for I adore you. My Lord,</hi> interrupted <hi>Eugenia</hi> impatiently, <hi>theſe repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſeleſs, and I will believe all you would have me. Ah! Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Souza</hi> paſſionately, <hi>let me have at leaſt the pleaſure of telling you this time; I ſuffer ſo much, that I fancy it might very well be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, and 'tis the only ſatisfaction I ſhall have in the misfortunes that are ready to oppreſs me. I vow to you, Madam, the Paſſion I have for you has not exacted the Order which the King has given me, more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motives have obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of this Marriage, and our diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience will draw upon us all his anger. And of what importance can this match be to the King,</hi> anſwered <hi>Eugenia?</hi> who begun to ſuſpect him
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57998:48"/>guilty of Artifice, <hi>No, Cruel Man,</hi> continued ſhe in a Faſſion, <hi>'tis you, who miſuſe the Royal Authority, for the dividing two Hearts whom you thought took pleaſure in being united. How have I been deceived in the eſteem I have had for you? How are you changed? All your Friendſhip is only Artifice; you have ſeduced the King, and would ſeduce me: But this is not the ſecureſt courſe for you, and by theſe means, you will draw upon your ſelf all my hatred. Eugenia</hi> ſpoke theſe Words with a great deal of Grief, and Anger, and accopam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſome Tears: What a Spectacle, and what a Diſcourſe was this to poor <hi>Souza?</hi> He was ready to renounce what he loved, to diſobey the King, to be accuſed of a Criminal Infidelity in regard of his Prince, to loſe his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Fortune, and perhaps his Life, and all this in favour of a Rival and a Miſtriſs, who accuſed him of Impoſture and Cruelty. He
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57998:49"/>was ſo lively pierc'd with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and tears, that he could not forbear ſhedding ſome himſelf. And after having eyed <hi>Eugenia</hi> ſome time, without being able to anſwer her. <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>do not fear any thing from the King, nor my Artifices, Madam, I deſerved a kinder Treatment, but you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to compleat my misfortune, and deprive me of the pleaſure of being pittied by you, which was the only one I durſt aſpire to. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to force you from</hi> Don Henry; <hi>I never had even the leaſt hopes you would change your ſentiments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of me, and I would only have been a little more certain of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Yes, Madam,</hi> continued he, with an extream Grief, <hi>I love you too much to make you unhappy: Our Marriage could not make you happy, wherefore I muſt Renounce it; and though this refuſal perhaps will coſt me my life, I would rather run to death, than loſe your eſteem, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57998:49"/>ſooner endeavonr your Happineſs than my own Fortune: I do not deſire you ſhould come before the King, and joyn your diſobedience to mine; I ſhould be but a little better juſtified, and I ſhall expoſe my ſelf alone to his Choller, as ſoon as you ſhall have have made me a litle more certain of your averſion. My Lord,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Eugenia,</hi> in Confuſion at what ſhe had ſaid, and what ſhe had newly heard, <hi>ſo far from hating you, I have ever had a perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for you, I eſteemed your Merit as ſoon as I knew you, but I was not acquainted with your Love before I was engaged, and I did not believe the Kings Orders would be ſo fatal to us. Alas! they are only ſo to me,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Souza, you will injoy in Peace what you love, and I am deprived of what I adore, and oppreſt with the hatred of my King, I ſhall wait for death with impatience. Ah Count,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him in ſuſpence, <hi>I would not have my happineſs coſt you ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57998:50"/>Dear, and if your Life be concerned, I will do all I can to ſave you. 'Tis enough, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Count to her, falling at her Feet, <hi>I am content, and I am going to think how to ſatisfie you: No, my Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eugenia</hi> ſtopping him, <hi>it is not juſt you ſhould make me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by your unhappineſs; Duty and Friendſhip conſpire againſt my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I muſt obey, I muſt follow your Example; I have not ſo much force, and ſo much firmneſs as you. But what Torments ſoever it may coſt me, you may tell the King, that if your Life be concerned, I am ready to do all that is neceſſary to ſave you.</hi> She could not ſpeak theſe Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extream conſtraint and grief: The horrour ſhe figured to her ſelf in loſing <hi>Don Henry,</hi> put her into a Condition to have raiſed pity: And <hi>Souza,</hi> who ſaw all ſort of grief painted in her Face, told her in reaſſuring her, <hi>Madam, it is for me to conquer my ſelf, my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57998:50"/>love has ever been concealed in ſilence, and this ſeaſon is very improper to make it appear. You love</hi> Don Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>he loves you; you have both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great hopes to enjoy your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; you never loved me; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any hopes you would; let me die, I ſhall be content provided the King believes me innocent, and you allow ſome Tears to my Misfortunes.</hi> The Count went our having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe Words, and did not wait for <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s anſwer, who was in the Cruellſt perplexity that ever was, admiring <hi>Sanza</hi>'s Gneroſity, fearing the Kings Power, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely concerned for her love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Henry</hi> came to her Houſe, as ſhe was ſtill in theſe Reflexions, and asked her the reaſon of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſaw in her Face. She made him a ſincere recital of all the Count had newly ſaid to her; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Generoſity and his Conſtancy: But as we ever fear to loſe what we love, <hi>Don Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57998:51"/>could not aſſure himſelf of <hi>Souza</hi>'s Reſolution; he fancied there was never ſuch an Honeſt Wellbred-Man, as could reſiſt an ardent love, and ſo favourable an occaſion, he could not ſuffer himſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by the ſtrong reaſons <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> brought to reaſſure his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſaid to her the moſt touching things imaginable upon his fears; he would have gone, and flung himſelf at the Kings Feet, and offered him his life inſtead of his Miſtriſs: But ſhe let him know that it was to expoſe two Heads inſtead of one to the anger of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and this Declaration would without doubt include him in the ſame diſgrace, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more than this Declaration to ſtop <hi>Don Henry;</hi> they both agreed that they ought to content themſelves with employing all the Friends they had at Court to ſerve the Count <hi>de Souza,</hi> in the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that threatned him.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57998:51"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Souza</hi> was to make his Court the day following: The King did not fail to ask him, if he had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted thoſe Orders: He anſwered with a profound reſpect, that he ſhould be ever ready to obey his Highneſs; but he had acquired ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reputation, and had yet ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſerved the State, that he could not reſolve to Marry, and that ſuch Engagements evermore took up the better part of the Cares, that are due to ones Prince. The King much diſpleaſed at this refuſal, did no longer doubt, but he had an Intrigue with <hi>Elvira,</hi> and told him furiouſly, <hi>That a diſobedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject could not render him good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and bid appear no more in his preſence.</hi> The Count went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way oppreſt with ſorrow, and was no ſooner at his Houſe, than a Captain of the Guards came to Command him from the King to leave the Kingdom with the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. He received this Order with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57998:52"/>all the reſpect imaginable, and not reproaching himſelf with any Crime, nor imputing any thing to the King of his misfortune, and Sacrificing all to his love, he went out of the City ſome moments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without murmering, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going to any Friends Houſe for fear of being oblig'd to ſee <hi>Elvira.</hi> The Count <hi>de Souza</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile being ſpread a little time after through all the City, the beſt ſort of People pitied him, and in the Grief that <hi>Elvira</hi> was in for his a fence, ſhe could not forbear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſecret joy, being he had refuſed <hi>Engenia,</hi> ſhe fancied, (as it is uſual to flatter ones ſelf) that ſhe might well be the Cauſe of that refuſal; and entertaing her ſelf with that thought, ſhe reſolved to employ all her Friends ſecretly to ſolicite <hi>Souza</hi>'s return, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ask it her ſelf. This incident did help much to encourage the Confidence and Friendſhip ſhe had
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57998:52"/>for the Count <hi>de Sanzay;</hi> ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that in the offers of Services, and the promiſes he had made her, he contributed very much towards the hindring the Execution of this Match; ſhe imparted to him all the Griefs that <hi>Souza</hi>'s abſence gave her; ſhe even confeſſed to him one day, that the indifference ſhe had before for the King was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven changed into an averſion, ſince this Exile. <hi>Sanzay</hi> laboured in Court with her, to cauſe <hi>Souza</hi> to be recalled: All the better ſort of People at Court begged the ſame of the King, but their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were uſeleſs; Jealouſie is not appeaſed like other troubles; and the King being ever inexorable. <hi>Elvira</hi> had coldneſſes for him that they would have been capable of revenging <hi>Souza</hi> if he had known them, and if he had been a leſs good Subject.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57998:53"/>
                  <p>He was ſome time deliberating into what Kingdom he ſhould go into Baniſhment, and for what Quarrel he ſhould expoſe his Life.</p>

                     <hi>FRance</hi> had at length, in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace, lulled aſleep the Rage and Fury of the Civil-Wars; all things were preparing in that Kingdom for the Marriage of <hi>Charles</hi> IX, with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> II. Queen <hi>Margarite,</hi> who in the inteſtine troubles of the moſt Cruel Wars, had ever carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along with her Divertiſements and Pleaſures, prepared to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57998:56"/>this Marriage by ſuch Sports and Rejoycings as were worthy of the Princeſs. But what <hi>Souza</hi> ſought was quite different from Joy. And <hi>Pius</hi> V, had in his Politick Zeal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to joyn with him, to make War againſt the <hi>Grand-Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> finding an occaſion of Signalizing the Zeal he had ever had for Religion, took the Road of <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe called the Iſle of <hi>Zantes,</hi> where was the Randezvous of all the Chriſtian Troops. He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Employ of <hi>Don John,</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V, who Commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces, and was Generaliſſimo. He mounted a Galley, tho <hi>Don John,</hi> knowing his Merit, and having Contracted a Friendſhip with him in <hi>Spain,</hi> would have given him a more Conſiderable Command. The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces aſſembled in the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> The Armies

Tho the Count of <hi>Souza</hi> had no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57998:57"/>very conſiderable Employ in that Battel, he was one of thoſe who gained the moſt Honour, and all he ſought was to die in that occaſion. He was mortally troubled at the Advice he had received ſome days before, that <hi>Don Henry</hi> had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and that <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s diſpleaſure ſtill continued.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the grief and ſlight of <hi>Elvira</hi> became an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable rigour to the King. The Duke <hi>d' Avero</hi> was in deſpair, and could no ways remedy it. All thoſe, who took a juſt intereſt in the Affairs of State, made uſe of that occaſion for to force this love from the heart of <hi>Don Sebaſtian: Count Sanzay</hi> employ'd himſelf in it more cunningly than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The King combated on all ſides, and extreamly vexed he ſhould be ſo much in love with <hi>Elvira,</hi> uſed all manner of Efforts to overcome that Paſſion: But he was too deeply engaged, and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57998:57"/>himſelf againſt a Love he was not able to triumph over, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching himſelf, that he had not yet performed any thing Glorious, he reſolved to abſent himſelf from <hi>Elvira,</hi> and go ſeek in his Enemies Territories the means of ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and curing himſelf. While he made theſe Reflexions, the report of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and <hi>Violanta's</hi> Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age became publick. Their Son called <hi>Don Antonio</hi> appeared openly at Court, and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> obtained the Priory of <hi>Crato</hi> for him. The King diſapproved in himſelf the inequality of his Uncles Match, but feared to become culpable of as great a weakneſs. He cauſed all things neceſſary to be prepared for a ſpeedy departure, he ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to over come that Paſſion, and to begin the triumph of it, he granted the return of the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> upon the preſſing ſolicitations of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> who had ever been his Friend, and who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57998:58"/>fully juſtified him in his opinion.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Sanzay</hi> believing this time was favourable for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, began to make the Propoſals of it to the King, and in the deſire that this Prince had to make ſome Voyage to cure him, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately propoſed to him, the going into <hi>France,</hi> where he would find Feaſts, Divertiſements and Sights worthy of him: But the King ſought for Glory, and not for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; his trouble was too great to ſhew himſelf in a Court filled with ſo much joy. That Ambaſſador repreſented to him, how the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> had ever been in a ſtrict Union; but the King his Maſter deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it always, and to make it even more binding; how it was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that their Councils would conclude a Marriage betwixt the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Marguerite</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Siſter, who joyned to her High-Birth, a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57998:58"/>thouſand Beautiful Qualities, that tendred her worthy of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarchs. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Propoſition as an advantageous mark of eſteem and friendſhip on the part of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. But his Mind and Heart were in too great a perplexity to come to a ſpeedy determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in an Affait of that Importance. He told the Count <hi>de Sanzay,</hi> that there required time to conſider of it; and he would propoſe it to his Council, and give him an anſwer within eight days: This Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Debated in Council, but all the Members having particular Intereſts to hinder this Marriage, and the King himſelf having no great inclination to it, the Count of <hi>Sanzay</hi> made the advantages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to no purpoſe, which the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> might receive from that Allyance. Cardinal <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> always oppoſed it. The Penſioners the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57998:59"/>King of <hi>Spain</hi> had in this Council diſapproved it likewiſe, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour was at length conſtrained to take his Audience of leave, and to return into <hi>France,</hi> without having ſucceeded in that Affair, or made any progreſs upon the Heart of <hi>Leonora.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wits, and the greateſt Gallants not being always the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Buſineſs and in Love. All theſe Propoſitions, and others that were made to the King to prevent the Voyage he was reſolved to make into <hi>Africa,</hi> were not capable of diſſwading him from it. And when he Communicated to his Council the deſire he had to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Moors,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeing he could not raiſe Troops enough for that Expedition, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with all his force the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Deſign, and the Duke <hi>d'Avero,</hi> who notwithſtanding ſo many Obſtacles, had not abandoned his Ambitious Project, would by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57998:59"/>reaſons hinder an abſence, that might quite deſtroy a Paſſion he had ſeen budding with delight.</p>
                  <p>But the King was fixt in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, he was no longer willing to ſee <hi>Elvira,</hi> he would fly her, and Court Glory, and for a pretext to this Deſign, he repreſented to his Council, how <hi>Mulei Moluc,</hi> to whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his Succours, had newly routed the <hi>Moors,</hi> with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men only that the Grand-Signior had given him, and was ready to chace away his Nephew <hi>Mahumet</hi> from the Throne; that his Heart was as great, and his Forces more conſiderable than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi>'s; that Enemies who deſtroy one another, were not difficult to be Vanquiſhed; and in fine, that he might take advantage of the diſorder the Civil-Wars had brought that Country into. They were forc'd to yield to the reaſons, and to the ardour of <hi>Don Sebaſtian:</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57998:60"/>Orders were given for the fitting out four Galleys, and ſome Ships; Troops were raiſed, and the King went but with a ſmall Force into <hi>Africa,</hi> whither the Duke <hi>d' Avero,</hi> the young Duke <hi>de Barcellos, Don Lewis,</hi> the Count of <hi>Souza,</hi> who was arrived ſome days before, and all the other Lords followed him: And <hi>Elvira,</hi> treated ill by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neglected by her King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by her Lover, returned into the Convent, the Duke <hi>d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vero</hi> had cauſed her to come out of, and there gave her ſelf up ſo to grief, that a lingring Feaver took her, that was not judged dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at firſt, but in a ſhort time made a conſiderable change in her Perſon. Though the King had neither Forces nor Ships enough, to undertake a great War againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> who were in their own Country, and had beaten an Army much more numerous, he did things that ſurpaſſed all hopes and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57998:60"/>expectations. He gave in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Teſtimonies of his Valour; he was in Perſon in the leaſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. He went into the very Ports of the Enemies to burn their Ships: He Attacqued all that he found, without being daunted at the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Moors.</hi> Coming near <hi>Arſilla,</hi> he immediately reſolv'd to Beſiege it: That City is Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Sea ſide; its Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and In works being Fortified with all things neceſſary for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it had been taken formerly by the <hi>Portuguez.</hi> The King had not Troops enough to undertake that Siege: But the vexation he was in, when he conſidered how the <hi>Moors</hi> had gained from him that Conqueſt, and when he made reflexion upon the Glory which would follow that enterprize, made him paſs over all difficulties. he cauſed with a great deal of Expedition, to be prepared all things neceſſary for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that attempt; he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57998:61"/>the Garriſon, entred the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Scaling the Walls, and was in the midſt of its Inhabitants with two hundred Men at moſt of his Attendants. The <hi>Arſilians</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recovered from their firſt ſurprize, ſold their Liberty very dear, and Defended themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey vigorouſly. This Fight was Bloody; ſeveral were killed on both ſides upon the ſpot; and the King having at length made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a paſſage thro all his Enemies, and got to the Caſtle of the City, which vielded without fighting, upon Condition all the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women ſhould be left at Liberty, that had taken Refuge there, and no outrage ſhould be done them; the King willingly granted them this Condition, and entred the Caſtle, followed only by his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers. He went to ſee the Ladies, who were retired thither, and offered ſafe Conduct for what way ſoever they would take: One
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57998:61"/>amongſt others by an Air of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty made him deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to conſider her more nearly. He found that the Charms of her Face were anſwerable to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Shape: She was brown, and her Features were ſo fine, her Complexion ſo delicate, and her Eyes ſo piercing, that <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was amazed: He forgot <hi>Elvira</hi> in that moment, and afterwards Comparing the <hi>Idea</hi> he had of her Beauty, with hers he ſaw, he found that <hi>African,</hi> a thouſand times more Charming; he asked her Pardon for appearing with Arms in his Hands before her, and offered her all the Succours ſhe ſhould have occaſion for. But ſhe received his Compliments with ſo haughty an Air, and retired with ſo much Maieſty, that <hi>Don Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> inquired, who ſhe was. They told him, that ſhe was a Princeſs called <hi>Almeida,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Mahumet;</hi> that this King having
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57998:62"/>already loſt two conſiderable Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels againſt <hi>Moluc</hi> his Uncle, had ſent her to that City, where he believed her in more ſafety than in the midſt of his Kingdom, which <hi>Moluc</hi> furiouſly ravaged.</p>
                  <p>He had no ſooner learnt the Name and Quality of that <hi>African,</hi> than he remembred that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal his Uncle, had ſpoke to him of her formerly. He was vexed he had not ſhew'd her more reſpects: He asked to ſee her, but ſhe let him know by the Governour of that City, that the greateſt mark of goodneſs he could give, was to conſent to her retreat without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and ſhe prayed him not to make uſe of the Rights of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt her Liberty: The King made known to this Governour, that he impatiently longed to pay her the Devoirs he could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf of, before he knew her; but this Envoy told him ſo plainly, that his Viſit would be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57998:62"/>ſo extream a violence to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that this King conſented at that inſtant to her departure, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the deſire be had to ſee her again. She departed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and retired towards her Brother. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could not loſe the <hi>Idea</hi> of her Beauty; he thought of her night and day, and ſometimes repented he had let her depart: if there had been no more required than Beſieging of Placea, and Taking of Cities for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her again; he would have undertook the moſt difficult Sieges; but he could not learn to what Place ſhe was retired. He feared he ſhould diſpleaſe her, if he puſht his Conqueſts farther, and his Council of War was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let him engage farther in an Enemies Country.</p>
                  <p>His Principal Officers remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, how the Troops he had left, were not ſufficient to keep and defend the Places he might Conquer, and if he went on at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57998:63"/>this rate, he muſt employ all his Army in Garriſons. He was obliged to return to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> Crowned with Honour, and full of the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Almeida.</hi> The other Lovers put on their Chains again; and <hi>Souza</hi> not being able to ſee without grief the happineſs of <hi>Don Henry,</hi> and being evermore in fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſgraced at Court, retired to one of his Country Houſes, where he became ſo much in Love with ſolitude, that there was no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite than an Order from the King to make him leave it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was given to the Duke <hi>d'Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> that his Daughter was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Sick in the Convent where ſhe made her abode. He went to ſee her, but did not find her in a Condition to be brought to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> She died four days after: Her Father was a long time in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection, having paſſionately loved her, and not quite loſt all the hopes he had conceived from her Charms. The King was ſenſibly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57998:63"/>grieved at her Death; but as his Mind was poſſeſſed with another <hi>Idea,</hi> his grief was not ſo violent as 'twould have been at another time.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> ſeeing that Love had not been Aſſiſtant to his Ambition, was willing to ſee if War would make it more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. He did all he could to enflame the Paſſion <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had for Arms. The King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him Orders to cauſe Forces to be raiſed in all Parts; he zealouſly ſeconded his Deſigns, how troubled and averſe ſoever Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> ſeemed to be to them. The Duke was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſenting to this Young King the Glorious Succeſs he had in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Conqueſts he had made with a little handful of Men. He aſſured him, that if he would return thither with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Army, he would render himſelf Maſter of all <hi>Tituan</hi> and <hi>Alarache</hi> in a little time. <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi>'s
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57998:64"/>Courage needed not to be raiſed, and never Man loved Arms ſo much as he, but he could not reſolve to make War upon <hi>Almeida</hi>'s Countrey. She ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his Mind, with that Majeſtick Air with which ſhe had received him in <hi>Africa;</hi> he feared her Indignation more than that of the Mightieſt Kings; and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have followed his Warlike Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour without renouncing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he had for her.</p>
                  <p>While his Mind floated between theſe two Motions, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he had put into <hi>Arſilla</hi> ſent him word, that <hi>Moluc</hi> had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his Nephew a third time, in a ſet Battel, that with a handful of Men he led, he had defeated in that laſt Battel an Army of ſixty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand Horſe, and ten thouſand Foot; that he had newly conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Mahumet</hi> to fly the Kingdom, and 'twas to be feared, that this Conquerour, after having drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57998:64"/>his Nephew out of <hi>Africa,</hi> would recover the Places the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> had in that Country.</p>
                  <p>This piece of News inſpired <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> with ſo much Courage and Emulation, that he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Glory which <hi>Moluc</hi> had acquired, as a Jewel he had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him of, and which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make him reſtore; he impatiently longed to ſignalize himſelf againſt him, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was but too ſoon offered, for the good of the State. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> being drove out of his Country, came ſometime after with <hi>Almeida</hi> to take refuge in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The King learn't with an expreſſible Joy, that he ſhould ſuddenly have the happineſs of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Princeſs again, who had Charmed him, and who he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen but in that Inſtant, and had ſo often deſired to ſee ſince that moment. He would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately have made them a Magnificent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57998:65"/>Entry, but that the King and Princeſs let him know, that Pomp and Triumph were not very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the deplorable condition they were then in. The King went to meet 'em with all his Court; he Embraced <hi>Mahumet</hi> a thouſand times; he rendred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpects to <hi>Almeida,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Civilities were paſſed on both ſides. <hi>You ſee Sir,</hi> ſaid that Princeſs to him, <hi>I am come to Demand the Succours you offered me ſo obligingly in</hi> Arſilla. <hi>Have you not forgot that Goodneſs,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe, in a Modeſt and Langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Air, <hi>or rather, do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you have ſeen me? Never any firſt ſight made ſo much impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a Heart, Madam,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> paſſionately, <hi>as that rencounter did upon mine, and you have acquired abſolute Power over me from that moment. Don Sebaſtian</hi> continued this Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till they were arrived at
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57998:65"/>the place that was prepared for their reception.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Mahumet</hi> had made known to the King, the Juſtice of his Cauſe; he repreſented to him, the <hi>Moors</hi> being divided, it would be eaſie for him to vanquiſh them; that if the <hi>Portugez</hi>'s would but deſcend into <hi>Africa,</hi> tho with but mean Forces, they might render themſelves Meſters of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he had newly been ſtript of; how the Enterprizes the King had already made, and the Glorious Succeſſes he had had there terrified all thoſe People; and when they ſhould ſee him, who was born their King, joyn'd to thoſe who had already Vanquiſhed 'em, they would come of their own accord, and range themſelves under their Power. Glory and Love incited <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> much more to that War, than all the reaſons <hi>Mahumet</hi> could invent: His Valour had a long time diſpoſed him to make
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57998:66"/>ſome Enterprize in <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Almeida</hi>'s Beauty had rendered him too ſenſible of her Misfortunes, to neglect the attempt of revenging her. The Council of <hi>Portugal</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Deſign with all its might; <hi>Almeida</hi> knew it; ſhe went to the King, ſhe Employ'd all her Charms; ſhe lamented her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. A ſenſibe Heart makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſiſtance againſt the Tears of a Beautiful Perſon; he promiſed to Aid her, notwithſtanding theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles; ſhe gave him ſome hopes of being beloved, and he cauſed Troops to be raiſed in all parts for the Execution of this Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>How great a Comfort was this to <hi>Almeida,</hi> in her Misfortune! She ſaw her ſelf Adored by the moſt accompliſhed King that was then in the World; ſhe ſaw that her Beauty Triumphed over all Policy, and over all the Forces of <hi>Portugal;</hi> ſhe was perſuaded, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> would Sacrifice all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57998:66"/>to her Revenge. Her Brother of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told her, that ſhe was Miſtriſs of his Fate, and hoped, they ſhould ſuddenly be Re-eſtabliſhed upon the Throne: But that which ſtill Augmented the pleaſingneſs of theſe hopes, was, that ſhe found <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> as Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he was Amorous; and that ſhe was yet more ſenſible of the Affection he had for her, than in the Cares he took in her Favour: She would have been ſorry that any other had rendred this Good Office to her Brother; and eſteem and acknowledgment conſpiring in her Heart in favour of <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> gave Birth there to a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion little different from that the King felt for her. If he ſpoke to her paſſionately, ſhe heard him with delight; if he continually and eagerly ſought her out, ſhe never met him but with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream joy. The moſt fatal Amour has ever in its beginning, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57998:67"/>Pleaſures to engage us; this at firſt laid only Charms to view in the ſight of thoſe Lovers. All the Court was with Juſtice alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at it: Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> uſed all her Efforts to deſtroy it: <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Henry</hi> oppoſed it with all his Power; but the King was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, theſe Obſtacles the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed him, and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to leave a free Courſe to his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to take a Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> to implore Succours of his Uncle, in Favour of <hi>Mahumet.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, after the Ambaſſadour he had in that Court had agreed with <hi>Philip,</hi> that <hi>Guadalouppe</hi> ſhould be the Place of their Interview; and gave Order at his Departure, that the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King, and his Siſter, whom he left at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſhould be Treated and Reſpected as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> came to the Rendezvous, accompanied
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57998:67"/>with one of his Daughters, and all the Lords of his Court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> with great Teſtimonies of Joy and Affection: He endeavoured to diſſuade him from ſo dangerous an Enterprize: But danger does but the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame Great Souls. He then Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not to go in Perſon to that War; but it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being he would have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his life a thouſand times for <hi>Almeida</hi>'s ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> (at length being deſirous to try if Pleaſures would not have more Power than Reaſons over the Mind of that young King) cauſed Turnaments, Liſts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to be made for to Divert him. He even cauſed <hi>Catharina Michela,</hi> one of the Daughters he had by the Deceaſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his third Wife, and whom he had brought with him to <hi>Guadelouppe,</hi> to conceive ſome hopes of the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> And as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:57998:68"/>was then Married again to <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Niece, and Siſter to <hi>Maximilian</hi> II; the Princeſs <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina Michela</hi> would have been glad to have freed her ſelf from the Power and ill humour of a Mother-in-law; ſhe was Ambitious; and the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> being hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſhe took care to engage him, and even engaged her ſelf a little: But <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of Re-eſtabliſhing <hi>Almei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s Brother upon the Throne, was not much moved with all theſe attempts, and would quickly have returned to that Charming <hi>African,</hi> if <hi>Philip</hi> had not ſtaid him with the hopes of ſome Troops, which he promiſed, and perhaps would have given him, had it not been for the Obſtacles that were raiſed by the Princeſs <hi>Katherina,</hi> by earneſtly deſiring <hi>Ruy Gomes de Silva,</hi> at that time Favourite and Miniſter of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to haſten the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57998:68"/>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> continually poſſeſſed with the thoughts of that War, and <hi>Almei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s Beauty, was not ſenſible of the Pleaſures of that Pompous Court, nor the marks of kindneſs which the Princeſs daily gave him. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi> writ a thouſand kind enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging things to this King, which the more augmented his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To little purpoſe it was <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had told him, that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had written to him; that this War was not reaſonably to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with <hi>Portugal</hi> Troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; that beſides them, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to have fifteen thouſand <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> It was to little purpoſe, he aſſured him, that he would give him five thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as ſoon as his Affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> would give him leave. Nothing could ſtay <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian;</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> who fancied that the Princeſs's Beauty, and the deſire of being in his Alliance, would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57998:69"/>perhaps be capable to perſuade him from this Deſign; or at leaſt, make him ſtay yet ſome time at his Court, offered him <hi>Catherina Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chela</hi> in Marriage. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> did not flye off ſo much as he would have done, if he had not ſtood in need of <hi>Philip.</hi> He made ſome Court to that Princeſs, which put her in ſome hopes; ſeemed to reliſh the Pleaſures of that Court with leſs diſquiet: Remained alſo there yet ſome time with little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, for the having the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſo often promiſed.</p>
                  <p>The Court he made to <hi>Catherina Michela</hi> in theſe hopes, was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to <hi>Almeida.</hi> All thoſe who approached her, took delight in exaggerating things to her, which put her in deſpair; and as the divers Paſſions and Intereſts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons even adds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the News that comes from afar off, the report ran in <hi>Portugal,</hi> that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was going to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57998:69"/>Marry <hi>Catherina Michela.</hi> A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who loves and fears is but too credulous; <hi>Almeida</hi> Figured to her ſelf a thouſand things far more ſtinging than all the malice of her Enemies could have Invented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject: <hi>How vainly did I flatter my ſelf with the Power of my Charms,</hi> ſaid ſhe ſometimes, <hi>how weak are they, and how am I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? The Princeſs</hi> Catherina <hi>has more than I have; ſhe is in Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory, I lie under Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Shame! Her Father is a Prudent and Fortunate King, whom the greateſt Princes would be proud to be Alied to, and I have but one Brother, whoſe diſgrace is capable of diſperſing the moſt Zealous Friends.</hi> Theſe and ſuch other like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did ſo trouble her, that ſhe was ſometime without writing to <hi>Don Sebaſtian:</hi> This King reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with her ſilence; but as ſhe was prepoſſeſſed with his infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe gave ſo ill an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57998:70"/>to all that came from him, as ſhe fancied he only made her theſe reproaches, for the having a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to quit her, and made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Letters.</p>
                  <p>The King not being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any longer the trouble he was in at <hi>Almeida</hi>'s ſilence, and ſeeing the propoſitions and delays of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were only vain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements to retain him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at length to return to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and deſired <hi>Philip</hi> to ſend him with the ſooneſt all the Troops he could. He found <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi> in ſo great a grief, that he could not ſee it without being much concerned. He made her his Complaints; ſhe made him, her Reproaches, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undeceived of their ſuſpition, were more charmed than ever, with one another.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> let <hi>Don Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> know, how the Sedition of the Rebels encreaſed daily in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57998:70"/>how he was afraid that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince would get from under his Power; how he was oblig'd to ſend a great many Troops thither, and this diſorder hindred him from ſending the Succours he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. All theſe Obſtacles did not at all cool the Ardour of <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> And <hi>Philip</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted he had ſtill the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he ſent the Duke of <hi>Medina Coeli</hi> to him, who was one of the moſt Eloquent and Underſtanding Politicians of <hi>Spain,</hi> to repreſent to him, that the Rebellion in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> augmented from day to day, which putting the King his Maſter in great fears, he found himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to conclude a Truce with the <hi>Turks,</hi> in which he would cauſe him to be comprehended, if he thought good; and that being in Conference about that Treaty, he could not ſend Troops into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> againſt <hi>Moluc,</hi> for as much as a part of that Country was Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57998:71"/>to the Port, and <hi>Moluc</hi> was a Friend and Confederate of the <hi>Grand Seignior's. Don Sebaſtian</hi> anſwered that Ambaſſadour, that he was very much ſurpriz'd, that <hi>Philip</hi> had made a Truce of three years with the <hi>Turks;</hi> that in thinking to avoid their Incurſions into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he gave 'em time to Fortifie themſelves in <hi>Africa,</hi> and fill it with Forces, which would carry into the Heart of <hi>Spain,</hi> after that Truce, a more Cruel War than that he feared. He added, that he did not think it convenient to be Comprehended in this Treaty; that 'twas requiſite for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt to leave him the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of aſſiſting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Irruptions of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and thus the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would aſſure himſelf of <hi>Italy</hi> by his Truce, and of <hi>Africa</hi> by the War that the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make there. The Duke of <hi>Medina Coeli</hi> returned into <hi>Spain,</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57998:71"/>but little ſatisfied with his Embaſie. Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> who had Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the State with great Prudence, died at that time. All the World fancied that the trouble <hi>Don Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>'s Deſigns gave her, occaſioned her Death. And the King having put his Army in a Poſture of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> went out of his ſolitude to accompany the King in that War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> followed by all his Nobility, his Guards, and a great number of Voluntiers went to the Cathedral Church of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where having with great Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony cauſed the Standard to be Bleſſed, which he would carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Africa,</hi> he put it into the hands of <hi>Chriſtopher de Tavora,</hi> and as all the Court fancied he was going to return to his Palace, he went to to the Port; and having met with <hi>Almeida,</hi> who was taking the Air with her Brother in a Chariot, coming up, he told them: <hi>That all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57998:72"/>was preparing to revenge them, and in a little time he would re-eſtabliſh them upon the Throne of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers. So many Obſtacles,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Almeida, have hitherto oppoſed your good Intentions, Sir, that I ſhall not promiſe my ſelf any Succours from your Highneſs till you are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued. Well, Madam, we muſt then Embark,</hi> reply'd the King in a Tranſport, <hi>I accuſe, as well as you, my Love of too much ſlowneſs, and you ſhall not ſee me defer any longer:</hi> He mounted his Galley, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid theſe Words, <hi>Mahumet</hi> and his Siſter accompanied him, and he Commanded the Duke <hi>de Avero</hi> to cauſe all his Forces to Embark. During the eight days he was Employ'd in putting them on Board, the King never went aſhore. He himſelf cauſed the Seamen to labour: He examined the Built of all the Ships; he Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Equipages, to ſee if there was nothing wanting to his Fleet;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57998:72"/>and ſhewing <hi>Almeida</hi> the Ardour of the Paſſion he had for her, by the care he took to Revenge her: This Princeſs anſwered ſo many Kindneſſes with as much Love as the delicacy of her Sex would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of. As the King never went from his Ships, and all the Lords remained there with him, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies came there to ſee 'em; and <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> who ſeemed to have Eſtabliſhed his Empire upon the Waters, had round about him a Floating Court, that amidſt the hurry of Embarking, would how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have been very agreeable, if the trouble of parting had not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the Pleaſures which thoſe would have reliſhed there, whom Love had united: <hi>Violanta</hi> quitted <hi>Don Lewis</hi> with all the grief that a real affection can be capable of in ſuch an occaſion. The Paſſion the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> had for War, ſhared his Heart with the Love he had for <hi>Leonora;</hi> and as ſhe gave
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57998:73"/>her ſelf up entirely to her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe was much more troubled than her Lover at their parting. The Duke <hi>d'Avero's</hi> Ambition finding an opportunity to ſatisfie it ſelf in that War, made him quit <hi>Lisbon</hi> with joy: But what Power ſoever Glory had over <hi>Don Henry,</hi> he had all the pains imaginable to Renounce the Pleaſures he enjoy'd with <hi>Eugenia. Souza</hi> found ſome Comfort in thinking, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Bonds of Marriage, in a ſhort time his Rival would be no more happy than himſelf. The Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who was arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> to accompany the King in his Voyage, and had ſtill a great deal of Vigour, and a ſtrong Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for War, was very glad that this Occaſion was offered for the inſtructing his Son by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by the Advices he might give him, according to the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Occurrences. And at length the King departed full of joy, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57998:73"/>of hopes, with the Flower of the Nobility and People of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and was accompanied by <hi>Adrias de Sylva</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Porto,</hi> and <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Menſis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conimbre.</hi> The whole Fleet made Sail with a fair Wind; but as the Kings Galley took its turn to go out of the Port, it ſtruck with ſo much Violence againſt a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Ship, that its ſides were broke to pieces, and a Seaman of that Galley was kill'd at the ſame time in his Boat, by a Canon Shot, that the City had Fired upon the Kings depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe two accidents made the moſt Zealous <hi>Portugals</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſeemed to be an ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to that Enterprize; even <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi> appeared alarmed at it, ſhe conjured the King to put off the Voyage till a more favourable ſeaſon: She told him ſeveral times, that ſhe would rather chooſe to Renounce the Crown, and paſs the reſt of her days in all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57998:74"/>and obſcurities poſſible, than to expoſe his life to Dangers, the ſole <hi>Idea</hi> whereof made her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but the more kindneſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms ſhe made appear to <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> the more eager was he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Voyage, and all the Fleet arrived quickly at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> regaled the King with great Splendour and Magnificence, and made all the Court during eight days reliſh all the Pleaſures that Iſland could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
                  <p>The King cauſed all poſſible Sail to be made towards <hi>Africa;</hi> this Fleet in a few days, came between <hi>Tangier</hi> and <hi>Arſilles.</hi> There he cauſed his Army to Diſembark, and after having made <hi>Almeida</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Place where he had ſeen her the firſt time, and having ſaid to her the moſt tender things ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable upon that point; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appointed the Quartering of his Troops. With an exact care he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57998:74"/>ſought the moſt advantageous Poſts; he Encamped one part upon the Sea Shore, and in the moſt Commodious Places. His Army was compoſed of thirteen thouſand Foot, fifteen hundred Horſe, or thereabouts, and thirteen pieces of Artillery. He went every Night with an indefatigable Ardour to Viſit all the Quarters: He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the braveſt; he excited the moſt languiſhing, flattered ſome, made promiſes to others, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes willing to awaken their Courage by a tender pity, he ſhewed them <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and his Siſter, cruelly driven out of their Dominions, and promiſed 'em all great Recompenſes on his and that Princeſſes part. <hi>Mahumet</hi> on his ſide addreſſing himſelf to all the <hi>Africans</hi> he ſound in his way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to engage them in his Party. Some yielded to theſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations. <hi>Almeida</hi> drew the Hearts of all thoſe who ſaw her;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57998:75"/>ſome Officers even Charmed with her Beauty, and moved with her Brothers Misfortune, came and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to ſerve them. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Mahumet</hi> having proved their ſincerity, received them with joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moluc</hi> well knowing that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was Ambitious and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, would have Treated a Peace with him, and have given him all the <hi>Chams</hi> the <hi>Portugals</hi> pretended to have Conquered, for the making good to him the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that War, and for thoſe People to Cultivate in all Peace and Safety they could have in their own Country. This Propoſition made <hi>Mahumet</hi> tremble, fancying, that ſo advantageous an Offer would make the King abandon a Party, that could not be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him: But <hi>Almeida</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing her ſelf all ſhe deſired from her Charms, and the Love of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> reaſſured her Brother,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57998:75"/>and did not at all doubt, but that the Ardour which the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> had to Serve her, would make him refuſe more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offers. He himſelf came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after to aſſure him of the ſame, and made anſwer to <hi>Moluc,</hi> that the greateſt Charges of the War being already made, he would not hearken to any Propoſition of Peace, till <hi>Moluc</hi> ſhould give him <hi>Alarache, Tituan,</hi> and the <hi>Cape de Agero,</hi> which were three places of Extream importance to the <hi>Moors,</hi> and of great advantage to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes. Moluc</hi> enraged at this demand, and ſeeing how ſmall were the Forces which the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was at the Head of, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him haughtily: <hi>That when</hi> Morocco <hi>ſhould be Beſieged, he would think of that Propoſition, and he fanſied he ſhould have time enough to think of it, and it would not be neceſſary to make or hear ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Moreover, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> in the mean time ſeemed to be enſlamed afreſh by the Eyes of <hi>Almeida.</hi> He could have wiſhed, that all his Forces had had the ſame Heart, and the ſame Eyes as he had, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating their Lives as Generouſly to that Princeſs, as he was going to Sacrifice his. <hi>Moluc</hi> being a very prudent Man, and knowing that a Battel oftentimes decides the Fate of a State, and is not to be undertaken without all poſſible ſureties, or in the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, offered him ten Miles of Land round each Fortreſs he had in <hi>Aſrica,</hi> if he would conſent to retire; but he was reſolved to fight, he only breathed Victory, and all other things ſeemed to him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57998:76"/>of his Valour and Love. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Army to be Fortified on one ſide, with high Ramparts of Earth, and with Waggons; and the Sea and the City ſerved him for Trenches on the other ſides. The <hi>Moors,</hi> who Border upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Cities, were ſo alarm'd by this Army, that they ſled into the Mountains: The Cities of <hi>Tituan, Alarache,</hi> and ſome others, were all deſert. <hi>Moluc,</hi> without being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this diſorder, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided between Prudence and Vallour, did all his Experience could teach him for his defence: And though he was ſeized with a very violent Fever, he departed from <hi>Sale,</hi> where he had given a Rendezvouz to ſome Troops. His Natural Brother, who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Fez,</hi> and whom he had given the Command of the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey of that Province, joyned him near <hi>Alcazar,</hi> with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and five or ſix thouſand Foot.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:57998:77"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moluc</hi> extreamly weakned by his Sickneſs, was conſtrained to put himſelf in a Litter to Viſit the Quarters of his Troops, and to ſee what condition his Cavalry was in. He cauſed himſelf to be carryed through all his Army, and fearing among his Troops he ſhould meet with ſeveral Partizans of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and judging, that ill-intentioned Souldiers would be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the day of Battel in his Party, than amongſt his Enemies, he declared before all his Army, that he would permit all thoſe who had more inclination for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> than for him, to retire to his Enemies. And beſides this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, being willing to make known to all the World, that he deſpiſed the Enemies Forces ſo much, as to ſend 'em Succours, without being in any fear, and thinking fit to upbraid the Honour of the Malecontents, and favour a Depart he could not hinder, he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57998:77"/>choſe all thoſe whoſe fidelity was ſuſpected by him, of whom he made a flying Camp of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe; he placed at their Head <hi>Mulei-Cheique,</hi> a famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of that Nation, who having been infinitely in love with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida,</hi> gave reaſon to fear that he was for her Intereſts, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go view the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Army, to keep it ever in play by frequent Courſes, and continually to Skirmiſh the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Though <hi>Mulei-Cheique</hi> had ſtill a great Paſſion for <hi>Almeida,</hi> and could ardently have wiſhed to ſerve her, this Artifice produced a quite contrary effect to what was expected; and this Generous Captain, conſidering this Order of <hi>Moluc</hi> as an effect of the extream confidence he had in him, would not belie an Opinion that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him, and rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Love than his Duty, he did all that the ſevereſt Honour
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57998:78"/>and greateſt Courage could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on that occaſion. All the others, animated with ſo brave an Example, joyfully followed the Vallour of ſo Generous a Leader, and as he had an extream deſire to ſee <hi>Almeida,</hi> his Love and Vallour carrying him farther than his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to have led him, he did things that ſurprized and alarmed the <hi>Portugals.</hi> He knew the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where <hi>Almeida</hi> was; he uſed a thouſand efforts to break through 'em, that he might go lay his Arms at her Feet, and made <hi>Don Sebaſlian</hi> and <hi>Mahumet</hi> ſo much afraid of loſing her, that they cauſed her to be ſecurely conducted into one of their Galleys, that was the propereſt to ſave her in caſe of need.</p>
                  <p>The King ſeeing that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Skirmiſhes cauſed a dread in his Troops, and having no longer any that might retain him in the City, went out to be ſooner ready to oppoſe the Aſſaults that were
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57998:78"/>made upon his Men. The day after, two thouſand Horſe, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Mulei-Cheicque</hi> advancing in good order towards the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the King having learnt how his Rival was at their Head, went to meet them only with ſix hundred Men. But what happy Succeſſes does not the preſence of a King produce amongſt his Troops? <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> at the Head of this handful of Men, Attacked the two thouſand <hi>Moors,</hi> cut them to pieces, and purſued the Runaways with ſo much violence, that he found himſelf above ten miles from his Army, accompanied only by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of <hi>Menezes</hi> his <hi>Marſhal de Camp,</hi> and without having near him any Troops that might relieve him from this danger. <hi>Moluc</hi> was ſenſibly vexed when he learnt this defeat; but did not judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to go out of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he expected there ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were to come from the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57998:79"/>Sea-coaſts, from the Cities of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan</hi> and <hi>Mechines,</hi> and was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous too, that the Enemies would come and attack him upon the main Land, which they ſeemed willing to do, to the end he might engage 'em very far into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and afterwards cut off their Correſpondence with the Sea; and he was reſolved to go find them out at length, when this reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was come, that he might fall upon their Rear, and reduce them into a preſſing neceſſity of all manner of Ammunition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving Battel but with extream advantage, and at the laſt puſh.</p>
                  <p>The King reſolved to attack the Enemies upon the main Land, as <hi>Moluc</hi> deſired it; he prepared all things towards a Battel, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Count de Souza,</hi> whom he had made Admiral, and whoſe Prudence he had tryed, to attend him at <hi>Alarache,</hi> with his Fleet, and advance his Conqueſts upon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57998:79"/>the Sea as much as the ſmall Forces he had left in that Fleet would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; he Confided <hi>Almeida</hi> to the Cares of this Count, and quitted her with leſs grief than hopes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having aſſured her, that he would ſuddainly bring <hi>Moluc</hi> to her Feet. He Commanded his Troops to quit the Sea ſide, and at length took the Field with all his Army, to go towards <hi>Alcazar</hi> to meet the Enemies.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57998:81"/>Forces were ever diminiſhing, and the Enemies approached, he ſent for <hi>Mulei Hamet,</hi> his Natural Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was ſtill young, and of little Experience, and told him: <hi>I know the great Art of War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a thouſand high Qualities, which you have not yet, and which you will likewiſe ſind difficult to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; however I place you now at the Head of above forty thouſand men, and make you General of all the</hi> African <hi>Cavalry: But I Command you at the ſame time to vanquiſh or die. So long as I ſhall have one moment of life left me, I will not let you want an Example; and if you do any thing unbecoming the rank I place you in, I ſhall employ the little ſtrength I have left to ſtrangle you with my own Hands: And for the reſt, Brother, I order you, if I die before the Succeſs of this Battel, to conceal my death with great care from all the World, and to put in my Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any one of our men, who ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57998:81"/>moſt reſemble me; to the end, that feigning to give Orders, and acting my part, the Enemies may not take advantage of the Conſternation that ſuch an accident uſually brings into an Army.</hi> Having ended theſe Words, he embraced <hi>Hamet,</hi> and cauſed him to be owned by all his Forces. After which he went out of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> and retired into the Plain, for to draw on the Enemies. He was perſuaded, that having better Officers, more Troops, and better Diſciplined, than the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> he ought not to fear the Iſſue of a Battel: But prudent as he was, he was loth to commit his Crown to the uncertainty of a fight, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we ought not to expoſe our ſelves to the Fortune of War, till after all the efforts of Prudence have not been able to produce any advantage; he let the Enemies March, without going to meet 'em, and fancied, that by ſtill permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to advance into his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57998:82"/>Territories, he had nothing more to do than to cut off their paſſage, to ſee them afterwards periſh by Famine, without coſting him ſo much as one Man. He was not able however to bring this Deſign to perfection, as well becauſe his illneſs reduced him to extremity, as by reaſon he was informed the ſame day in the Evening, that the Enemies were very near, and the two Camps might ſee one another, if the obſcurity of the night had not hindered it. He ſent as ſoon as it was day, his Maſter of the Horſe, at the Head of two or three hundred Men to obſerve the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Enemies, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that ſome Battalians of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army, that had paſſed a little River, repaſſed it in that moment, by order from the King, who judged it more convenient to be left between the two Armies. Theſe Troops which Filed off, made the <hi>Moriſh</hi> party believe, that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57998:82"/>ſight of them, put the Chriſtians to flight; and they carried with all diligence this News to <hi>Moluc.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> animated by this flight, cried out aloud, that they ought to purſue them, and they might cut them to pieces: But <hi>Moluc,</hi> ever wiſe, and ever prudent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed this too pert Ardor, and ſaid he demanded no more than their retreat, and if they fled, he ſhould vanquiſh according to his deſires, without his Army running any danger, or loſing one drop of Blood.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Moors</hi> were delibera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting upon this Affair, <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> cauſed his Council to Aſſemble, to know of his Chief Officers, if he ſhould give Battel that ſame day. The moſt part of them ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moluc</hi> had three times more Forces than the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were unwilling to run the riſque of a Battel: But the King fancying, that as at the Head of ſix hundred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57998:83"/>Men, he had put to flight two thouſand of the Enemies, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian would ever beat five or ſix <hi>Moors,</hi> went boldly out of his Camp, ranged his Troops in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel array, and divided them into three Battalions: The firſt was Compoſed of Strangers, who had their Officers at the Head of them, and of five hundred <hi>Portuguez</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, Commanded by <hi>Don Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> the ſecond and third were Compoſed of <hi>Portugal</hi> Troops: The Cavalry was at the two Wings in the form of a Triangle. The Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> Commanded the Right, where <hi>Mahumet</hi> was Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Troops that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, the Kings Standard was at the left with the Duke <hi>de Barcellos,</hi> and the Baggage was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Infantry and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Moluc</hi> felt the pangs of Death, he had ſtill the ſame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the ſame Conduct; he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57998:83"/>ranged his Army in Battel, with as much preſence of Mind, as if he had been in perfect health. He had forty thouſand Horſe, eight thouſand Foot, and thirty four pieces of Artillery. He kept to himſelf, the charge of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo, and placed his Brother at the Head of the Cavalry. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed immediately all his Infantry to March in the form of a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon, at the two points of which he placed two Bodies of Cavalry, each of ten thouſand Horſe; the reſt of the Horſemen were divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little Squadrons, and followed in equal diſtance, being ordered to March ſtill on, and ſurround the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army for the Engaging it on all ſides. When it was in preſence, it appeared ſo Weak to <hi>Moluc,</hi> that he thought himſelf ſure of the Victory, and thought of nothing but rendring it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. He would have made a Speech to his Souldiers, but his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57998:84"/>extream weakneſs would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to ſay four words. He cauſed himſelf to be put again into his Litter, and placed himſelf in the middle of his Troops, that he might be able to give Orders on all ſides, and ſee all that the two Armies ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſeeing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies make ſome Motion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſent one of his Querries to <hi>Almeida,</hi> for the aſſuring her that the Battel was going to begin, that he would loſe his life therein, or re-eſtabliſh her in her State; and after having given ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the moſt tender reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a Lover was ever capable of, he ſet all his thoughts to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Enterpize. <hi>Moluc</hi> on his ſide cauſed his Cavalry to March and extend in ſuch order, that being within a Canon-ſhot of the <hi>Portuguez</hi>'s, the two points of that Half-moon came and joyned behind the King's Arrier-Guard, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57998:84"/>that great Circle, filling by little and little, became ſtill more thick as it approached the <hi>Portugals,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the Chriſtian Army was environed on all parts by the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Cavalry, and took from the moſt faint hearted all means of running away. The <hi>Portuguez</hi>'s were daunted at the doleful aſpect of this danger, their fears were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled at the noiſe of the Fire of the <hi>Moors</hi> Artillery, which making frequent ſhots, by degrees broke the Files of the Chriſtians, and made great breaches in their Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> as ready as the Enemies ſhot, went to every rank to fill it, and alſo cauſing his Cannon to fire upon the <hi>Moors,</hi> he gave 'em Bullet for Bullet, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and fear for fear: But the <hi>Moors</hi> being ſtronger in Artillery than the Chriſtians, did much more Execution, and the <hi>Portugez</hi>'s were ſo terrified, that the King gave the Signal of the Battel, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57998:85"/>ſtop this diſorder. The <hi>Moors</hi> made a vigorous attacque upon the Vangard; the Chriſtians op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them Courageouſly. <hi>Don Henry</hi> at the Head of his Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, made all bend under his blows that oppoſed his paſſage, and relieved ſuch of the <hi>Portugez</hi>'s as were moſt preſſed, ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the numbers of the <hi>Moors,</hi> which were greater than the <hi>Portugals,</hi> thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> could hardly keep for ſome time things in Equality: But the King, who impatient to ſee the Victory ſo long in ſuſpence, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it to declare in his favour, quitted the left Wing, where there was not yet any danger, to run to the Vanguard, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fell on with the greateſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He advanced at the Head of his Troops: The Kings ardour made him be every where, he Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crified a thouſand lives to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had Conſecrated his to.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57998:85"/>Victory durſt not remain longer doubtful at the coming up of <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> not being able to ſupport the Valour of the Chriſtians, animated with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their General, gave ground at the firſt Shock, and notwithſtanding the endeavours and threatnings of their Leaders, who uſed their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make them ſtand to it, and put inceſſantly new Men in the places of thoſe who fell: Theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> were broken three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and put to flight, to the loſs of all their Colours.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d'Avero,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Right Wing, charged the <hi>Moors</hi> Cavalry that came to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque him, and his heart greedy of Glory, made him fly to the greateſt dangers, and triumph in all places. His Squadron in the form of a Triangle was ſo cloſe, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued ſo vigorouſly the Enemies Cavalry, that he conſtrained it to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57998:86"/>retreat in diſorder. <hi>Mahumet,</hi> who had likewiſe ranged himſelf in in this Body, Attacqued, Fought, and Purſued his Enemies like a deſperate King, who choſe rather to loſe his life than his Crown. The Duke <hi>d' Avero</hi> fought with a great deal of Valour, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Conquering carried him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far amongſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> A Body of Horſe coming up to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them, he judged it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent not to ſuffer himſelf to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed by thoſe Squadrons, and to retire in good order with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, hoping theſe Troops would divide themſelves in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and he might return to the Charge with yet more vigour and ſucceſs than before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he turned back upon thoſe who purſued him; but he found them all ſo firm, and ſo well united, that his Squadron being weakned with its loſſes and wounds, could no longer bear the Enemies Aſſaults,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57998:86"/>but were conſtrained to retire in haſte, and not finding a ſaſe place in the Army, they caſt themſelves amongſt the Cavalry and Infantry with ſo much diſorder, that it put thoſe Troops into a Confuſion, which the <hi>Africans</hi> made great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide the Body of the Army, where the Kings Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and the Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> were placed, made a horrible ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Moors,</hi> purſued them to their Canon; and thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> finding the King every where, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that all the Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Hero's, or that this Hero alone compoſed all the Army. The Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King in all places, and did a hundred things worthy of his Birth and great Courage: The <hi>Moors</hi> terrified and flying, took refuge even in the Quarters where <hi>Moluc</hi> was, who falling into an extream fury at this diſorder, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57998:87"/>being reſolved to repair it or die, he roſe from his Litter, without conſidering that he was half dead, and cauſed himſelf to be ſet on Horſeback with a great deal of pain, reſolved to ſtay the flight of his Men by his Example, or to put them to Death himſelf. Thoſe who were about him, uſed all their endeavours to retain him, and even ſeized the Reins of his Horſes Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but his Courage making him forget his weakneſs, the Crowd of the Runnaways and Fugitives ſtill augmenting, and the King at the Head of his Men coming pretty near that Quarter, he put his hand to his Sword to diſperſe thoſe who ſtopped him, and this Effort quite conſuming his Strength and Forces, he fainted away, and fell into the Arms of his Men, and died ſome moments after, putting his Finger between his Lips, whether it was for vexation that his Men run away, or to make them remember they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57998:87"/>were to conceal his Death. And the Prudence of this <hi>Barbarous</hi> King ſo well compaſſed his Deſigns in the laſt moment of his Life, that dying it ſelf could not raviſh from him Victory; and he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brave and prudent even in the Arms of Death.</p>
                  <p>However the Renegado's, who were about <hi>Moluc,</hi> concealed his Death with a great deal of care, inſomuch as the Army of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> weakned by this accident, was ſo far from flying, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been vigorouſly repulſed, it recovered Forces out of its own ſhame. The <hi>Moors</hi> Rallied with freſh Troops, and returned to the Charge with more Valour than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Vanguard, where <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> made his Courage be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, gave ground at its turn, and though the Chriſtians, who were in that Body, had killed above two thouſand of the <hi>Moors,</hi> there came again freſh ones in ſo great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57998:88"/>multitudes, that they were forced at length to yield to the numbers in that place; and all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who remained there, having uſed all their Arms againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and being at length come to Ponyards, loſt their lives, appea ring to be rather weary with Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than Conquered. All the Brave Voluntiers that <hi>Don Henry</hi> led there, being dead, this General was encompaſſed by the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> and fell at length under their numbers and their fury. The King received there a Muſquet ſhot in his Right-Shoulder; but not ceaſing to Act for this wound, tho dangerous, and ſeeing his Vanguard was defeated without recovery, he run to the Left-Wing where the Duke <hi>d' Avero,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rallied ſeveral times his Men, changed Horſes, and Succoured thoſe whom the Enemies preſſed the moſt, was at length killed by a Muſquet ſhot. As he was the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57998:88"/>Soul of that Body, his fall put the <hi>Portuguez</hi>'s to a rout: <hi>Mahumet</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in vain to retain them, by his Example and his Voice. They no longer knew any Body, but the Conquerours, they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Knees to the <hi>Moors,</hi> inſtead of ſtanding up in their own defence.</p>
                  <p>The King running to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and being acquainted with the Dukes death, who was dear to him, revenged it upon all thoſe he met with; he fought amongſt the Souldiers, and engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt the <hi>Moors;</hi> he anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Chriſtians with few Words and a great many Examples, and caſt admiration, fear and ſurprize amongſt his Enemies by his Valour. He had three Horſes killed under him without being daunted, and though he was already wounded, he did not ceaſe to Attacque, Strike and Relieve; but he could not vanquiſh the fury and number of his Enemies, nor communicate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57998:89"/>his Courage to his Troops. At length hazard conſpiring with the <hi>Moors</hi> againſt the <hi>Portugals,</hi> Fire ſeized the Chriſtians Ammunition for the Compleating their Defeat, and put ſo great diſorder in all their Army, that Horſes, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Waggons, Ammunitions, Arms, Tents, Pavillions, and all the reſt of the Baggage being confuſedly heaped one upon another; ſome were ſtifled, others burnt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cut to pieces by the Enemies. The young Duke <hi>de Barcellos</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen from his Horſe in that Confuſion, was taken Priſoner; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Chief Officers were killed, or put out of condition to fight by reaſon of their wounds: The <hi>Portugals,</hi> who in their flight would have taken the way of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla,</hi> were all killed or drowned, being deceived by the River of <hi>Mucaſen,</hi> which ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Ocean does, whoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it receives, was almoſt dry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57998:89"/>when the Army paſſed it on their march thither, but the Tide being high at their return, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did not know the places where they had all forded it. The Defeat was ſo General, that of thirteen or fourteen thouſand Men the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army was compoſed of, there hardly eſcaped an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from that Battel. In the mean while, the leſs fearful and moſt zealous, ſeeing this General Rout, they ſought the King on all ſides: But <hi>Chriſtopher de Tavora,</hi> who carried his Standard, having been killed, they could not find him, and deceived by a Colours that very much reſembled it, which <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward de Menezes</hi> had, they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it inſtead of the other, fancying that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had ranged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf near it. Thus the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alone among his Enemies, was notwithſtanding his Valour oppreſt with numbers, and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not being capable of ſeconding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57998:90"/>his Courage, he was conſtrained to yield to the fury of the <hi>Moors.</hi> All the Chriſtians, who returned from this Battel did affirm, that he had received only one wound in his Shoulder, which was not Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; that he fell not among the dead, and that they had ſeen the Enemies take him Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time this Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came famous for the loſs of three Kings. <hi>Moluc</hi> died there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all that a Wiſe Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is capable of in ſuch an Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Mahumet</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> routed, and willing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Cruelty of his Enemies, who would not have failed to have Sacrificed him to the repoſe of the State, endeavouring to eſcape, was drowned in the River of <hi>Mucaſen. Don Sebaſtian</hi> was loſt there, and ſo many rare Qualities that were obſerved in him, made his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and all thoſe who knew him, extreamly regret his loſs, and leſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57998:90"/>a great Example to all young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who keep not their Courage within the bounds of Prudence, which ought to preſerve Kings for the advantage of their State, and the affection of their People.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was giving the Bloody Battel, which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his own ruine, the deſtruction of his Kingdom, and the death of ſo many famous Warriers, the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> Signalized himſelf as much as the few Men that were in his Ships could make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing. He made often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Deſcents upon the Land with his Troops; burnt the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs and Villages he met with in his way, put to flight all thoſe who Guarded the Coaſt; Beſieged the City of <hi>Allarache,</hi> and battered it ſo Vigorouſly, that the greateſt part of the <hi>Moors</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned it, and had only left in it a weak Garriſon. <hi>Almeida</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer the Naval Army, than
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57998:91"/>the other Forces, learnt <hi>Souza</hi>'s Conqueſts with an incredible joy, and fancied, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> fought with no leſs advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moluc.</hi> She ſlattered her ſelf with the hopes of ſeeing her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within a little time again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and her Lover co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Glory: But theſe thoughts did not laſt long, <hi>Souza</hi> quickly received the News of the Kings Defeat, and the rout of all his Army; he inſtantly acquainted <hi>Almeida</hi> therewith, and told her, it was neceſſary of thinking to ſecure themſelves. What a ſad piece of News was this to that Princeſs! ſhe remained as motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and loſt the uſe of her Senſes at this Diſcourſe. After which ſhe made reflexion upon the Valour of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> upon the ardour he had made appear to revenge her; and not being able to figure to her ſelf, that he was to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, having ſo much Courage
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57998:91"/>and ſo much Love, ſhe ſent for him, who had brought the ſad Tydings to <hi>Souza,</hi> who confirmed what <hi>Souza</hi> had told her. He rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her all had paſt in that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and when ſhe ſaw this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was no longer to be doubted of, and that ſhe had loſt her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and her Lover, ſhe fell into ſuch a deſpair, as gave reaſon to fear it would coſt her her life.</p>
                  <p>She had ever loved <hi>Mahumet</hi> very tenderly, and often ſhed Tears for his death, but when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his Intereſt had cauſed the ruine of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> ſhe murmured againſt that Brother, and imputed to him all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of this King. <hi>It is I alone, alas,</hi> ſaid ſhe a moment after, <hi>who am the cauſe of</hi> Don Sebaſtians <hi>ruine; had it not been for the Love of me, he would not have ſuccoured my Brother, nor loſt his life. It is I that drew him out of the Heart of his Dominions, to Sacrifice him to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57998:92"/>my Ambition, and the Cruelties of</hi> Moluc: <hi>He was adored by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> contined ſhe, <hi>beloved by his Allies, feared by his Enemies. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Prince gave ſuch hopes of a happy Reign as he did. He was ardent in Glory, fearleſs in Dangers, indefatigable in labour, and all theſe fine Qualities have only helped to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the misfortunes I have plung'd him into. How fatal was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of</hi> Arſilla <hi>to him, it was there I ſaw him Victoriouſly Charming; he ſaw me, and loved me; I fancied that Victory would ever have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he did not think, I was to be ſo fatal to him; into what an abyſs of miſchiefs has this interview pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated us?</hi> While <hi>Almeida</hi> made all theſe Reflexions, the Count <hi>de Souza,</hi> ſenſibly concerned at the Kings loſs, was thinking with a great deal of prudence and care of the means of repairing, or at leaſt, hindring its fatal Conſequences; he raiſed the Siege of <hi>Alarache,</hi> to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57998:92"/>go Reſcue the <hi>Portugals</hi> that were beaten; he reaſſured the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of thoſe places <hi>Portugal</hi> had in <hi>Africa;</hi> he augmented the Garriſons with all the Troops he could put into the City; he gave out, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was not dead, and the Chriſtians aſſured he was only taken Priſoner. He promiſed the Colonels and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who had eſcaped this Defeat, that the Kings Ranſom ſhould be ſhortly Treated for, and that he would recompence at his return the fidelity of thoſe, who ſhould have rendred him ſervice during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He run over all the Coaſts as far as <hi>Tangier,</hi> to gather up the Remnants of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army, which that Defeat had diſperſed. He was acquainted by thoſe, who had eſcaped from the Battel, that above three thouſand Chriſtians were killed upon the place, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix thouſand <hi>Portuguezes</hi> were taken Priſoners, and above

He was extreamly concerned at the grief this piece of News would cauſe in <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and was more ſenſible of the loſs the State had by this accident, than of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57998:93"/>particular advantage his death might be of to him in the ſequel. But he could not forbear enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome hopes, and fancied that if ever <hi>Eugenia</hi> could be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a ſecond engagement, all he had done for her, would move her to ſome acknowledgement; in the impatience he was to ſee her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſuddenly Embarqued all the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had eſcaped from the Battel; he thought of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing <hi>Almeida,</hi> and ſtillre ſpecting her the King had loved, and had committed to his care, he asked her what place ſhe would chuſe for her retreat, that he might Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to it, even to the hazard of his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almeida</hi> without Brother, King, Lover, Relations, Friends and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; odious to all the Nations, who had intereſſed themſelves in that Quarrel, knew not to what place to carry her misfortunes. Of all the Train ſhe had brought into

                     <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhe had only left a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Maid, who came into her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice a little before <hi>Mahumet</hi> was drove out of his Dominions. This young Perſon had been taken at Sea by the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Pirates ſome time after that <hi>Almeida</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Spain;</hi> ſhe was given to that Princeſs, becauſe ſhe had a thouſand fine Qualities, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed her from other Slaves, and her Relations had not yet been able to Ranſome her, by reaſon of the troubles that were in that Kingdom, which cauſed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi> to wander into ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Princeſs had taken an affection for her, and treated her with a great deal of kindneſs. This Slave ſeeing her in ſo great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, told her, that in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the favours ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſhe offered her a Retreat at <hi>Venice,</hi> that the <hi>Bailo</hi> of that Republick was her Relation, and ſhe was ſure, if ſhe would become a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57998:94"/>Chriſtian, as ſhe had promiſed <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſhe would, her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would willingly grant her a Refuge that would not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of her. <hi>Almeida</hi> willingly accepted the proffer, <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> cauſed her to be conducted to <hi>Venice,</hi> and then made Sail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Kingdom was in an extream Conſternation. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knew not if <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was dead or alive: All the World la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his misfortunes, and no body knew his fate. Thoſe who were well intentioned, maintained he was ſtill alive, and a Priſoner in <hi>Africa.</hi> The Seditious ſaid, that though that were true, they could not reprieve him from Captivity, becauſe War had drained the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and they could not find Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough in the Kingdom for his Ranſome. Others cauſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to run, how he was dead: The People would have a King;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57998:95"/>the beſt Politicians, and thoſe that were moſt honeſt, doubted of all, and ſaid nothing. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeen but Relations, which ſeemed all to confirm the News of the Kings Death. <hi>Spain</hi> had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places upon the Confines of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> that bordered <hi>Portugal:</hi> Thoſe who were Governours of them ſtopped all the Pacquets that were ſent into <hi>Portugal.</hi> There were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen new Liſts of the dead; the whole Kingdom was in Mourning; each City in Tears; all Families regretted the loſs of a Father, a Hsuband, a Son, or a Brother; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes one alone deplored all theſe Perſons together; and the Council was at length conſtrained to appeaſe the Murmurs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to cauſe Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> to come out of the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Calcobaſſa,</hi> to which place he was retired, and to proclaim him Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Kingdom, in the abſence of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> his Succeſſour to the Crown.</p>

                     <hi>Eugenia</hi> uſing all her endeavours to have certain News of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was aſſured after ſeveral ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact enquiries, that he had loſt his life in that Battel. The grief ſhe was in ſurpaſſed that of all other Widows; her Affliction was not confounded in the Publick Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe made it be diſtinguiſhed by its exceſs. <hi>Souza</hi> was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner arrived, than he would render the Devoirs that Decency exacts on ſuch occaſions: He was told ſhe was returned into a Religious Houſe, where ſhe admitted of no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits: He had promiſed to himſelf ſo much pleaſure in ſeeing <hi>Eugenia</hi> again, and diſengaged from <hi>Don Henry,</hi> that he could not without an extream trouble, find himſelf diſappointed of that happineſs. The Abbeſs of that Convent was his Aunt: He went to beg ſhe would obtain of <hi>Eugenia,</hi> that he might ſee her for a moment; but this Widow preſcribed her ſelf too ſevere Rules
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57998:96"/>to conſent to that interview, which ſhe fancied would injure the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhe owed the Memory of her Husband, and ſhe ſtill ſo firmly oppoſed the meaſures that <hi>Souza</hi> took to diſcourſe her, that he was afraid, he ſhould be wanting in the reſpect he owed her, if he ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to procure himſelf that ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>While all <hi>Portugal</hi> was in Tears, <hi>Africa</hi> echoed with ſhouts of joy for ſo great a Victory. <hi>Hamet, Molucs</hi> Brother, was proclaimed King: He made an Entry into <hi>Fez,</hi> he brought thither in triumph <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humets</hi> Body, with a great number of Priſoners. After which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf to acquire the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He had means in his hands, that were ſure to obtain it: Several <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were among his Priſoners; he was Maſter of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> whoſe fate no Body knew. <hi>Philip</hi> ſtood in need of him: Theſe two Kings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57998:96"/>ſent Ambaſſadours to one another. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave to the Value of a hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in Jewels to the King of <hi>Fez;</hi> who likewiſe reſtored to <hi>Philip,</hi> without any Ranſome, all the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> that had been taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in that War. The report of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>'s death was renewed every where. New Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it were made Publick: It was ſaid, that he had not been met withal amongſt the Priſoners, and that having ſought for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead, a naked Man had been found, whoſe Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his, and was known to be ſo by ſome <hi>Portugal</hi> Priſoners. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> delivered this Corps into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governours hands of <hi>Ceuta.</hi> He likewiſe reſtored to <hi>Philip</hi> the Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> without Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and the Council thought fit at length to proclaim at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was dead, and to perform the Publick Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57998:97"/>that thoſe People are uſed to practiſe on ſuch occaſions, for the appeaſing the murmurs and the diſorders, that were cauſed by the Doubtful Fate of that unhappy King.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> was Crowned King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> At firſt great hopes were conceived from his age and his probity; but beſides that the Virtues of one Condition are oftentimes Vices in another, the change of our Fortune almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways changes the diſpoſition of our Mind. <hi>Henry</hi> became Haughty, Revengeful and Jealous. Few of the late Kings Courtiers kept in favour under this new Reign. He Perſecuted all thoſe who had ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the pleaſures of <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> he revenged himſelf on all, who had not ſhewn him reſpect enough, and had only applyed themſelves to the Kings Perſon. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> was the only one of the Antient Court,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57998:97"/>whoſe Credit was augmented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Henry.</hi> He had for her a great inclination; her Complaiſance, her Eagerneſſes, and the Affectionate Air ſhe made appear to thoſe ſhe had a mind to pleaſe, had engaged <hi>Henry.</hi> She came to <hi>Lisbon</hi> upon the firſt report of the loſs of the Battel, to know News of her Son, and Husband; ſhe deplored the loſs of the one's Liberty, and the Life of the other; and King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> uſed all his endeavours to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her Grief. <hi>Violanta</hi> was not beloved by this Cardinal, but as he had meaſures to keep with her, by reaſon of the Pretenſions of <hi>Don Anthony</hi> her Son, he did not ſhew her any hatred: She was gone into Mourning for the Death of <hi>Don Lewis;</hi> the better part of the Court had been to Condole with her upon her loſs. <hi>Henry</hi> had not ſeen her, becauſe he had not conſented to <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his Marrying her, for fear of being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57998:98"/>conſtrained to acknowledge <hi>Don Lewis</hi> for the Legitimate Succeſſour of the Crown. The Count <hi>de Souza</hi> was more in Favour than he had ever been: <hi>Henry</hi> knew his Prudence, eſteemed his Merit, and often followed his Counſels in the Government of the State: <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had ever ſhared in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and had ever applied himſelf only to the Perſon of that King. The hatred that <hi>Henry</hi> bore him for that reaſon, did not die with him; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make his Widow ſenſible of the effects of it: He brought Suits at Law againſt her, that were capable of ruining her, and maintained that the better part of her Husbands Eſtate had been alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Crown, and ought to be reunited to it. <hi>Eugenia</hi> had plunged her ſelf into ſuch an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſhe neither thought of State nor of Life, and believed ſhe ought not to manage any of thoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57998:98"/>things, after having loſt what ſhe loved. Her Relations were not favourites enough at Court to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake her defence. <hi>Souza</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his Credit to preſerve to her the Eſtate they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of, and did it with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. <hi>Henry</hi> Sacrificed his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Prayers of this Count, and took pity of <hi>Eugenia.</hi> But as the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> durſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſeeing her, ſince ſhe had ſent him Word, that he would diſoblige her, if he ſeemed to have that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; he contented himſelf with deſiring one of that Widows Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to acquaint her on the part of <hi>Henry,</hi> that he reſtored to her all her Eſtate, without declaring to this Relation, that <hi>Henry</hi> had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted this Act of Grace to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi> upon his ſolicitation; but the noiſe thereof was already ſpread through all the City; which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi> was informed of the the ſame time, they acquainted her with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57998:99"/>this News; ſhe appeared as little ſenſible of the Services of <hi>Souza,</hi> as the kindneſſes of <hi>Henry,</hi> ſo full was her Soul of Grief, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned was ſhe for things of this World.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having had Advice, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>'s death had been Proclaimed in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> made King, reſolved to joyn the powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Religion and Juſtice to the ſecret Practices he entertained in all parts, for the maintaining the Pretenſions he had upon that Crown. Conſcience in <hi>Spain</hi> is an Actreſs, that has ever a Principal Part in all things, and had the greateſt ſhare in this Intrigue. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> cauſed the moſt Learned and Famous Caſuiſts to be Conſulted, and Civil Layers of his Kingdom, and they unanimouſly declared, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> being dead, he might Seize on the Kindom of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Henry:</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57998:99"/>But whether <hi>Philip</hi> having other Wars to maintain, feared that the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> would by force of Arms defend the Crown, they had newly placed upon <hi>Henry's</hi> head, or was afraid this War would give thoſe People new remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> whom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty they had believed to be dead, becauſe they ſaw a Prince of their Country Succeed him, and of whoſe death they ſhould not ſo eaſily perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if a ſtranger ſhould Seize on the Throne; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> found the ways of Artifice, more ſure than thoſe of open Force, and thought it convenient to let <hi>Henry</hi> Reign, for the little time he had to live, rather than diſguſt thoſe People by too much Precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Duke of <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> was got out of <hi>Hamets</hi> Priſons, he paſſed the <hi>Straits</hi> to go into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and promiſed himſelf to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57998:100"/>ſatisfie in a little time, the tender impatience of <hi>Leonora,</hi> who had ſo long ſighed for his return. But <hi>Philip,</hi> fearing this Duke might occaſion new obſtacles to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Pretenſions, by reaſon of the Right the Quality of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Heir gave him to that Crown, reſolved to retard as much as he could his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. He employ'd all manner of Artifices to hinder the Duke from going to <hi>Lisbon:</hi> And as he knew that he was to paſs by Saint <hi>Lucar,</hi> he ſent Orders to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> who was Governour of that place, to detain him in that City as long as was poſſible for him. Some New Diverſion was daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to cauſe him to ſtay, and he ever found ſomething New and Magnificent to invite a delay. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pretexts had already been found out to ſtop him, when the Duke not being able to reſiſt any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57998:100"/>longer <hi>Leonora</hi>'s impatience, who deſired him inceſſantly by tender and preſſing Letters to return to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> reſolved at length to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Saint <hi>Lucar,</hi> and made known with much firmneſs to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> that he was reſolved to depart the next day. This Governour ſtill endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade him; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duke was obſtinate to be gone, he cauſed all his Equipage to be ſeized on with abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and told the Duke of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellos</hi> as gently as was poſſible for him, that being Governour of that place for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he could not ſuffer him to go away without Order from his Maſter; that he would write to him about it the next day, and that as ſoon as he received an anſwer, all the ways ſhould be open to him. The Duke ſurprized at this procedure, gave notice thereof to the Dutcheſs his Mother. She complained of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57998:101"/>that Violence to <hi>Henry:</hi> He aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, he would ſolicite her Sons Liberty with all the ardour he was capable of, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this occaſion of obliging the Dutcheſs, with ſo much joy, and ſo much eagerneſs, that ſhe no longer doubted, that what ſhe had ſuſpected of him was real.</p>
                  <p>This Dutcheſs had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqued how the other Virtue the Cardinal had ever made profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, ſuffered it ſelf to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſeduced by Pleaſures, which attend a Crown. She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Complaiſant to him; ſhe ſeemed young; was ſtill Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and having a Deſign upon the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhe was willing to procure <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſuffrage, and uſed all her endeavours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate her ſelf into that Kings Favour. Old Men as well as Children are uſually won by thoſe who flatter them: Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> took great delight in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57998:101"/>of that Dutcheſs, and fancying that Sixty ſeven Years, with a long Practice of all Virtues, were a ſure Preſervative againſt Love, he let his Eyes continually enjoy the Pleaſures of ſeeing that Dutcheſs, and abandoned himſelf entirely to the Charms that ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, without foreſeeing what it would come to. A Heart that never loved, is as much a Novice at Sixty years old, as in the tendereſt youth; and the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of a Beautiful Perſon, have the Art of taming the moſt Savage Virtue; that of <hi>Henry</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuſceptible by little and little: The Dutcheſs perceived his Love ſooner than he himſelf, ſhe ſaw it bud with joy, and applauded her ſelf in ſecret for that Conqueſt, that might be of ſuch advantage to her Deſigns. As ſoon as the King knew, that the inclination he had for the Dutcheſs, was love attended with all its diſquiets,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57998:102"/>he was extreamly concerned; he would have called his reaſon to his Reſcue; but love had drove it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; 'twas too far off to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, or to return, and all he could do againſt that Paſſion, was to ſhut it up in his Heart, to conceal it with care from the Eyes of all the Court, and to declare nothing of it to her who cauſed it. He had the pleaſure of ſeeing the Dutcheſs, and ſhe was ever Complaiſant. She ſeemed to know nothing of his Paſſion, but what he was willing to acquaint her with. He inſenſibly explained to her all he was ſenſible of after this manner. And as the kindneſs of Old Men is not ſo furious as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love, and that 'tis rather a ſweet folly than a ſtrong Paſſion, the violence he uſed upon himſelf, did not put him in too much pain, and he enjoy'd with tranquility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the Pleaſure of being near what one loves.</p>

                     <hi>Souza</hi>'s Paſſion was not ſo Calm, what reſpect ſoever he had for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>'s Orders, it was not without an extream conſtraint, that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed them: He ardently deſired to ſee her; could not forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king frequent Viſits to his Aunt, and the other Friends he had in that Convent; took delight in being under the ſame Roof with his Miſtriſs: They talked of her often to him, and the violence he uſed upon himſelf to conceal his love from all the World, did not hinder him from taking a great deal of Pleaſure in thoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: He had a Siſter whom he tenderly loved: She deſired him one day to accompany her to her Aunts, whom ſhe had a mind to Viſit, which he conſented to with joy. When they came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, they were told, that the Abbeſs was in a Parlour with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia,</hi> who could not refuſe ſeeing one of her Relations, who was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57998:103"/>lately arrived at <hi>Lisbon: Souza</hi> was full of joy at the News, and was going haſtily into the Parlour; but the fear of diſpleaſing her he loved immediately with-held him, and made him think ſometime up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Deſign He let the Abbeſs know, that her Niece asked to ſee her; and as there was no mention made of <hi>Souza, Eugenia</hi> ſtayed without thinking he was to come with his Siſter; he perceived ſhe was vexed and ſurprized to ſee him: The grief of having diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and the Luſtre of her Beauty, which ſeemed to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſince her Widowhood, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much trouble in that Lover, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> could not forbear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome pity, though at the firſt ſight of him, ſhe reſolved to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw: The diſorder, love, reſpect, and repentance that the Count made appear in his Eyes, and the remembrance of all he had done for her, ſtaid her for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57998:103"/>and after having thought upon what was her Devoir in that Rencounter, ſhe judged it more convenient to remain, than make it believed by her retreat, that ſhe took a particular care to avoid <hi>Souza.</hi> The Converſation was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; the Count durſt not ſpeak of his Paſſion otherwiſe than by tender looks, which a reſpectful fear ſometimes curbed, and which <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s ſeverity often refuſed to underſtand. This Interview per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing her, ſhe quickly found a pretext to withdraw: The Abbeſs being called away by ſome Duties of her profeſſion, retired preſently after: This Viſit was ſomewhat ſhort, and <hi>Souza</hi> parted from thence more charmed with <hi>Eugenia</hi> than he had ever been.</p>
                  <p>This Widow was afterwards ſomething concerned ſhe had ſtaid in a Company where <hi>Souza</hi> was preſent, and reproaching her ſelf ſometimes for having ſeen a Man,

But <hi>Eugenia</hi> poſſeſſed with the Memory of her Husband, could not ſuffer any other <hi>Idea.</hi> The Niceneſs of her Virtue fancied it Criminal to give Ear to ſuch propoſitions: She repulſed them with all the firmneſs that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility ſhe owed the Abbeſs, and the eſteem ſhe had for the Count

                     <hi>de Souza</hi> could permit her, and made them ſo well know, that ſuch Diſcourſes were not pleaſing to her, as they ceaſed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate.</p>
                  <p>The Pleaſure Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> enjoy'd with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza</hi> did not laſt long. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was then in <hi>Africa,</hi> and had cunningly concealed his Quality from all the <hi>Moors,</hi> found the means of eſcaping, and returned to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but was but coldly received by King <hi>Henry.</hi> All the Court immediately asked him News of <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> but as he had been amongſt the Common Priſoners, was one of the firſt that that had freed himſelf from Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Fate of this King had ever been kept very ſecret in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> he could ſay nothing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thereof. He ſaw the Dutcheſs, ſhe charmed him, and he fancied ſhe might be uſeful to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Pretenſions he had to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57998:107"/>the Crown: He thought, if ſhe joyned the right ſhe had to that Kingdom to his, they ſhould carry it from all others. He paid reſpects to the Dutcheſs, which met with a favourable reception; ſhe conſider'd his Pretenſions in the ſame Deſign as he had done hers. Great Intrigues were formed between them; and though ſhe kept great meaſures with <hi>Henry,</hi> he conceived ſo ſtrong a Jealouſie of that Union, that he made his Complaint to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, and fell in a rage againſt <hi>Anthony.</hi> The one without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning his Paſſion, promiſed the King to Renounce it in his Favour, and the other denied ſhe had any Correſpondence with that Prince.</p>
                  <p>Every thing Alarmed this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous King: <hi>Anthony</hi> durſt not be in any place where the Dutcheſs went; and as forbidding to ſee one another, does ſurniſh thoſe who have any diſpoſition to love, with the occaſion of making ſecret aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57998:107"/>which ever advances the aims of a Paſſion: <hi>Anthony</hi> who could not ſee the Dutcheſs in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſaw her in Private; he deſired ſecret Rendezvouzes of her, which ſhe was not able to refuſe him. They had mutual Intereſts that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the State; Policie ſerved Love in that occaſion, as Love ſerves Policie in others. The Dutcheſs aimed at a Crown: <hi>Anthony</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all his cares to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King. He was very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the People, he gained the Suffrages of the Principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City, who went to deſire <hi>Henry</hi> to name a Succeſſour to the Throne, and to conſider in that Nomination the Rights of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> and the Voice of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who declared themſelves in his favour. This Harangue fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Henry;</hi> he had conceived a mortal hatred to his Nephew, ſince he had ſancied him his Rival. He reſolved to deprive him at one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57998:108"/>Caſt of the Kingdom, and of the Dutcheſs, by Marrying that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He coloured this Deſign with the neceſſity of giving a Succeſſour to the Throne, for the preventing thoſe Wars the pretenders to that Crown, threatned the State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. He Communicated this Deſign to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza:</hi> He flattered her Ambition; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, notwithſtanding the inclination ſhe had for <hi>Anthony.</hi> This pretext did lure the ſimple; but there were two great obſtacles to this Marriage. <hi>Henry</hi> was a Prieſt, and ſixty years old. Kings never want able Men, who remove the Scruples and Difficulties that are contrary to their Deſigns. The Phyſiicans told him, he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of getting Succeſſours. Some Caſuiſts aſſured him, that he might eaſily obtain a Diſpenſation from the Pope for a Match ſo neceſſary to the State; and <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Caſtel Bianco</hi> was nominated Ambaſſadour
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57998:108"/>to his Holineſs, for the obtaining that Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof, was very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed. His Partizans talked pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that <hi>Henry</hi> was incapable of Marriage, and he could never have any Children, but ſuch as were impoſed upon him. <hi>Philip</hi> cauſed the Pope to be deſired he would not grant that Diſpenſation, and ſent to <hi>Lisbon</hi> a certain <hi>Jacobin,</hi> called <hi>Ferrand du Caſtilio,</hi> a very ſubtil Divine and Cunning Monk, who by the free and good Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Fathers of his Order had at Court, inſinuated himſelf cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly into <hi>Henry</hi>'s Favour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making known to any one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that he came from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and without acquainting any body with the occaſion of his Journey; he laboured under the Cloak of his Monkiſhip Habbit, and under the appearence of Piety, to effect and bring to paſs the Deſigns
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57998:109"/>of <hi>Philip.</hi> He coloured all his Practices with a great Zeal for the Church, and devoutly repreſented to <hi>Henry,</hi> that his Marrying would utterly deſtroy the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion; that the Hereſies which then Reigned, would be more Spirited by that Action; that the Hereticks, who pretend that Marriage is not incompatible with the Service of our Altars, would cite him amongſt all Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as an Example that would au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theriſe their belief, and would Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and that it would be much better to loſe all the Kingdoms of the World, than to make the leaſt breach in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith.</p>
                  <p>But what care ſoever the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> had taken ſince the Defeat in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> to perſuade the People that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was dead, they had not been able to eſtabliſh that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life ſo well amongſt them, but there
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57998:109"/>always ran ſome report in that Kingdom, how this King was ſtill alive. They learnt from time to time, ſome News of his Captivity: One of the Principal Inhabitants of the Iſles of <hi>Tercera,</hi> who had accompanied that unfortunate Prince in his Voyage, and had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the <hi>Moors</hi> Priſons, had ſo well perſuaded it to the People of thoſe Iſlands, that they ever made mention of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> as of a King who was living, in the Publick Prayers. He went to <hi>Lisbon</hi> himſelf to warrant this News, and to aſſure it to all the Court; but Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> would give no Credit to it, and fancied this rumour was only a New Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the putting by his Marriage. This Man was treated as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture; his Perſon was ſecured without any noiſe, and ſecretly diſpatched into the other World: <hi>Almeida</hi> being ſtill at <hi>Venice,</hi> heard all theſe rumours, and as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57998:110"/>with more Paſſion than any other, that they were real, ſhe gave eaſier Credit to them than any Body elſe, and by Letters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thoſe Friends ſhe had left at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to Contrive ſome means of Delivering <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> But all that came from that <hi>African</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was odious to the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> and this News was ſo ill entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Court, that the moſt diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed Politicians ſtiſled it in its Birth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> was yet more alarmed at <hi>Henrys</hi> Projects, than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was, he redoubled his Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to become King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to render himſelf worthy of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endeavoured to acquire new Partizans; he ſent to Solicite the Magiſtrates of all the Cities; he made known to the People, that it was for them to chooſe a King, becauſe the <hi>Salick</hi> Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received in that Kingdom, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57998:110"/>Crown wanting Heirs Males in a direct Line, the Election belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and that <hi>John</hi> I, one of their Kings, on ſuch another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, had been choſen by the People. He ſupported the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> flattered the Bold, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Weak: But his Love was yet more troubleſome than his Ambition; he loved the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs as much as the Throne, and was no more ſure of the Poſſeſſion of the one than of the Love of the other. When he had learnt that ſhe conſented to the Match which <hi>Henry</hi> Projected, he went to her privately, and told her, after having entertained her with the Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he made upon the Peoples Minds: <hi>Heaven is my Witneſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I leſs eſteem the Conqueſt of a Kingdom than that of your Heart, and if I did not believe that the Throne would one day advance me up to you, I ſhould never think of raiſing my ſelf up to it; I know you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57998:111"/>are worthy of a Crown, I alſo know you cannot fail of it; but I know not whether you had not rather chooſe to receive it from the Hands of</hi> Henry <hi>than from mine; and if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a certain Poſſeſſion before doubtful Hopes, you are not more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that King, as old and decrepit as he is, than to a young Prince, who loves you to odoration: But Madam, without particularizing the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that oppoſe the Match you have conſented to—Sir,</hi> interupted the Dutcheſs, <hi>thoſe would be uſeleſs, I know all that is contrary to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Kings part, and am willing to acquaint you with all thoſe that oppoſes it on mine; I do not find that</hi> Henry <hi>is lovely; you have all that is requiſite to pleaſe, I would prefer you with delight before that King, and in fine, I ſhould love you, if I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my Heart; but Prince, better regulated Motions are to be Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57998:111"/>ſpeak when we aim at a Crown: My endeavours are to reign, and tho I am not vain enough to abandon my ſelf to that fancy, I am ſo ambitious as not to neglect any thing that may place me upon the Throne. Ah! Madam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Anthony</hi> after a Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate manner, <hi>when we are ſenſible of Love, Ambition has not that Power over our Actions, and for my part, I call Heaven to Witneſs, I hardly ever dream of Reigning, but I think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly of you. That is not the way to pleaſe me,</hi> reply'd the, <hi>the Affairs of the Kingdom are much more preſſing than thoſe of our Love. When you have employ'd your thoughts with advantage upon the Throne, you will have time to think agreeably of me: Procure, Sir, your ſelf a Crown, and leave the Care to me of making you be beloved: If I am not as ſenſible as you, I am at leaſt more ſincere, and am willing to avow to you, that with a Crown you would pleaſe me more than the King; but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57998:112"/>that the King will pleaſe me more than you as long as you are not Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. As to the reſt, if you believe theſe Sentiments too ſevere for your love, think that 'tis not to be very indifferent to hear you in private and without anger, and to declare my ſelf in favour of your uncertain Cabals and doubtful hopes, againſt the ſincere and ſure Offers which the King makes me of his Crown. But, Madam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Anthony, you have continual favours for</hi> Henry. <hi>This is all I can do for you Prince,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>I will not openly fall out with the King, (nor would you Counſel me to do ſo) I have neither Forces nor Friends to offer you, we have both of us ſome Pretenſions to the Crown, I am willing to joyn mine to yours: Endeavour on your fide, while I ſhall Act on mine, and be perſuaded, that if I could be Miſtriſs of the Kingdom, without ſharing it with</hi> Henry, <hi>I would ſhare it with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57998:112"/>
                  <p>Theſe laſt Wards filled <hi>Anthony</hi> full of joy: He made a thouſand Paſſionate acknowledgments to the Dutcheſs, they both agreed at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to uſe their Efforts for the procuring Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> to be of their Cabal: <hi>Anthony</hi> perceiving, that oppoſing as he did <hi>Henry</hi>'s Marriage, he would not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Union, and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, believing, that being <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Friend, as he had declared himſelf he was, he would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times facilitate their interview.</p>
                  <p>This Good Father, who did not ſo much fear the Marriage of the Dutcheſs with <hi>Anthony,</hi> as with <hi>Henry,</hi> conſented to favour the Paſſion of thoſe two Lovers. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having exacted from them an authentick Declaration of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their intentions, believing he ſhould ever have means and time enough to deſtroy the tender Commerce he thought fit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if it ſhould once happen to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57998:113"/>be contrary to his Maſters Deſigns, this Religious acquitted himſelf worthily of that Commiſſion <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> not thinking Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> to be a Penſioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving a thouſand good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from him, declared to him part of his Projects, which the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Father, immediately gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to of <hi>Philip.</hi> He was very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and rendred himſelf neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Dutcheſs, inſomuch as ſhe only concealed to him her moſt ſecret Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>An occaſion that offered of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her, augmented the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe had in him. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was in no haſte to anſwer the Letters that <hi>Henry</hi> had writ to him concerning the Liberty of the Duke of <hi>Barcellos.</hi> He was ſtill detained at St. <hi>Lucars;</hi> the Dutcheſs his Mother was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, the People murmured, and the <hi>Jacobin</hi> ſeeing that this Detenſion might have ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57998:113"/>wrote ſecretly to <hi>Philip,</hi> and at the ſame time promiſed the Dutcheſs, that the Duke of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> whoſe particular Friend he ſaid he was, would doubtleſs give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to her Son, upon his deſire. And indeed the Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> went preſently after from St. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars.</hi> 'Twas given out, that the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> out of too much precaution had detained him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Order from Court. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ferrand</hi> ſeemed to be principal Agent in that Affair. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs was full of acknowledgment, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Letters, deſired this young Duke to paſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> and come and divert himſelf at that Court, pretending to be very deſirous of ſeeing him. But the Duke of <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> diſtruſted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Carreſs, and thought not fitting to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that Journey. The Dutcheſs his Mother not being willing, he ſhould engage himſelf further with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57998:114"/>
                     <hi>Leonora,</hi> ſent him word, that it was as unſafe for him to be at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> as at St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> ordered him to retire to <hi>Villa Viſola,</hi> where he would be Maſter, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear. What Inſtances ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Leonora</hi> had made to this Duke, he was forced to obey; War, Ambition, Abſence and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures had almoſt effaced her out of his Heart; and times and the cares of his Fortune, quite diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him from that Paſſion which had never been very violent.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Eugenia</hi> had paſſed ſome Months in the Monaſtry ſhe was retired into, the Counſels of her Relations, the Prayers of her Friends, and the neceſſity of her Affairs obliged her to return to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> All the Court Ladies made her their Viſits. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> was of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſhe made her ſome obliging reproaches upon the difficulties there was to ſee her, where ſhe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57998:114"/>was in that Convent. <hi>You would hardly conſent to ſee your Relations,</hi> ſaid that Dutcheſs to her ſmiling, <hi>and of all the Men in the World, the Count of</hi> Souza <hi>had only the happineſs of Diſcourſing you there.</hi> Tho <hi>Eugenia</hi> had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her ſelf for that interview, ſhe was however out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Confuſed at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; ſhe was afraid, they would ſuſpect her of having ſome intrigue with a Man who had loved her ſo long a time, and defended her ſelf as well as ſhe could from this Reproach. But the Dutcheſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved her Diſorder and Bluſhing, fancyed there was ſome intelligence betwixt thoſe two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> who former<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly juſtified <hi>Souza,</hi> acquainted the King, that he was in love with <hi>Eugenia:</hi> The Dutcheſs had been told it, and as Gallant Women are ever glad to make it believed, that the moſt ſevere are ingaged in ſome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57998:115"/>Intrigue of Galantry, this Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs continued maliciouſly that Railery, and reported every where, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> had a long time had a kindneſs for <hi>Souza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Widow was extreamly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her Honour; ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly vexed at <hi>Souza</hi> for having brought upon her that Diſgrace, tho ſhe very well knew it was not his fault. She reſolved never to ſee him more, and let him know every time he came to Viſit her, that ſhe was indiſpoſed, and could not ſee any Body. <hi>Souza</hi> knew not by what Crime he had merited all theſe Cruelties: He was ſure, he had never failed in his Reſpect to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and had ever Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed all things to her: he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that ſhe could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what he had done for her, and knew too well the ſeverity of her Virtue, to dare to undertake to write to her. She had left off ſeeing the Abbeſs of the Convent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57998:115"/>ſhe had made her retreat to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was ever talking to her in favour of him. The Relations of that Widow knowing what the Count had done for her, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Credit he had at Court, were deſirous ſhe ſhould conſent to Marry him; the Siſter of <hi>Don Henry</hi> her Husband, and for whom ſhe had ever had a great inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was a great Friend of <hi>Souza</hi>'s Siſter. They both went to ſee her, and <hi>Souza</hi> declared to her his love, and his deſpair. He deſired her to know what <hi>Eugenia</hi> could accuſe him of, and to procure him a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcourſe with her. And this Friend promiſed <hi>Souza</hi> and his Siſter to employ all the Power ſhe had over her, to their ſatisfaction.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN the mean time, the Pope made no great haſte to grant <hi>Henry</hi> the Diſpenſation that his Ambaſſadour demanded of him. The Cabals of <hi>Spain</hi> were ſtronger than the Solicitations of <hi>Caſtel Bianco.</hi> The People grew impatient, and feared the Wars, which the Pretenders to the Crown threatned <hi>Portugal</hi> with after the Death of <hi>Henry. Anthony</hi> in all places excited the murmurs; he had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57998:121"/>gained the Peoples Favour, and the ſuffrages of the Court. <hi>Philip</hi> had notice of all that paſſed: He order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> to ſeek out the means of ſtopping his Progreſſes; which the Father had Infallible ones to do, and refolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his being Baniſhed from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon. Henry</hi> was but too much diſpoſed to hate him; the Cabals he raiſed every where, and the love he had for the Dutcheſs, were ſuch Crimes, in reſpect of that King, as could not fail of drawing down his vengeance; but Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> was not willing to be the Informer, this was too contrary to the good and devout Character he affected; he would not involve the Dutcheſs in this Affair, he had particular Conſiderations for her: The Friendſhip and Confidence of thoſe two Lovers were neceſſary to him; wherefore he ſo behaved himſelf as to keep them both his Friends. <hi>Leonora</hi> was vexed at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57998:121"/>the Dutcheſs, being ſhe had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her Son from corning to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and fancied, that ſhe alone was the cauſe of this change: The peeks that Love cauſes between perſons of that Sex, become ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable averſions. Father <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> had ſome acquaintance with <hi>Leanora,</hi> from the time he ſo licited the Liberty of the Duke of <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>:</hi> She had made ſeveral Viſits to this good Father, to learn News of her Lover, and he had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the hatred ſhe had for the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, when he acquainted her, that the Duke of <hi>Barcellos</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go to <hi>Villa Viſola.</hi>
                  </p>

                        </gap>
                     </hi> hands a Letter that <hi>Anthony</hi> wrote to it he Dutcheſs, in which he let her know, that he had learnt, that his Holineſs would ſpin out the buſineſs of the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſo long a time, that <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould be dead before an anſwer would be given to it; that ſhe was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57998:122"/>too good to ſuffer the perſecutions of ſo uſeleſs an Amour, as was that of the Old Cardinal, and too Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el if ſhe did not declare her ſelf in favour of a Prince, who would infallibly put the Crown upon her head. This Letter ſaid enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke, and too little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dutcheſs, to accuſe her of a Formal Intrigue. There need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more than to ſhew it the King. Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> ſhewed it <hi>Leonora,</hi> as if he had found it by chance. She deſired the Father to give her that Letter: He obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied it, till he had made her promiſe, ſhe would never declare from whom ſhe had it; and after having given it her, he deſired her not to make any noiſe with it, but to ſhew it the King with as much caution and moderation as was poſſible, if the good of the State obliged her ſo to do. As ſoon as ſhe had this Letter, ſhe bethought her ſelf of the means to ſhew it to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57998:122"/>
                     <hi>Henry,</hi> and made choice of <hi>Phoebus Monis,</hi> who was <hi>Vereador</hi> of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and had great acceſs to the King, and was entirely devoted to <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> having been one of <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher de Tavora</hi> her Fathers Officers. She ſent for him, and told him, that it was important for the good of the State, and for his particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, that the King were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Letter, which was come to her Hands: And after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhew'd it him, ſhe begged him to let <hi>Henry</hi> ſee it, and told him, that ſhe found it in the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin's</hi> Church, which was the very place where the Dutcheſs had let it fall. <hi>Monis</hi> executed this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion very punctually. The King ſaw that Letter, and was in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream fury againſt <hi>Anthony:</hi> He Baniſhed him from Court, and ſent him to his Priory of <hi>Crato.</hi> But notwithſtanding all the meaſures the King took to hinder the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views of theſe two Lovers, <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57998:123"/>did not fail to take his leave of the Dutcheſs, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the <hi>Jacobin;</hi> they took meaſures to write to one another, and it was this good Father, who received and convey'd the Letters from and to either party, he was their deareſt Confident, and beſt Friend. They fancied they could not chooſe a more faithful Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent in their Commerce; they imagined, that they would ſooner open the Pacquets of all the Court, than thoſe that were addreſſed to the Religious, who have ever had in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> particular Priviledges and Prerogatives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s Siſter-in-law, often Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed her about Count <hi>de Souza</hi> as ſhe had promiſed him to do, and deſired her with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to permit the Count to come and ſee her, that notwithſtanding the repugnance her Scruples gave her to that Viſit, ſhe conſented to it, yet upon Condition, that it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57998:123"/>ſhould be in preſence of that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Friend; ſhe immediately ſent Word to the Count <hi>de Souza</hi> to come to <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s: How great was the joy of this Lover, who had ſighed ſo long a time for this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! He run thither with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but how great was the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when after having Saluted that Beautiful Widow, he ſaw more ſeverity in her looks than ſhe had ever ſhown him; he likewiſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied he ſaw there ſome anger, and was extreamly ſurpriz'd, when <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>'s Siſter being willing to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw a little to give them the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of entertaining one another, ſhe ſtaying her, told her, <hi>Is it to abandon me, Siſter, that you have engaged me to this Interview? And the violence I did to my ſelf for your ſake, does it not deſerve you ſhould be as good as your Word to me? I am very unhappy, Madam,</hi> anſwered the Count full of grief and reſpect, <hi>that the ſight of me is ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57998:124"/>to you: The love I have ſo long had for you, the endeavours I have uſed, and the care I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to conceal it even from your Eyes, ought not they to have appeaſed your Anger? You have not ſo well concealed your Paſſion,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eugenia, but that all the Court has known it, it has even ſince ſome few days cauſed reports to run, that are injurious to my Reputation; and notwithſtanding all the preſſing Solicitations of my Siſter, I ſhould not at preſent have conſented to ſee you, if I had not had the Deſign of begging you to ſtifle that Paſſion, and to avoid carefully for the future the occaſions of ſeeing me, far from ſeeking them as you do? Ah! Madam,</hi> cried the Count, <hi>could you put me to a more cruel Torture? Have you forgotten my paſt reſpects? Do you complain of my preſent Carriage? And do you think 'tis in my power to forbear loving you in the future? My Lord,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, <hi>I remember with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57998:124"/>acknowledgment, all you have done for me; I ſhould even ſee at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your affection without diſpleaſure, and ſhould with joy perſuade my ſelf, that you would ever love me: But I love my Honour, and will follow my Devoir. If I approved your Paſſion, it would be believed, that I ſuffered it in my Husbands Life time. It has been already but too much talked of, and I will not give ground for thoſe Calumnies. I loved</hi> Don Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>and he loved me; I deplore his death; I thought ever to cheriſh his Memory, and never elſewhere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Heart that I have given him. Does not Death break all manner of Engagements, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za?</hi> Don Henry<hi>'s Aſhes, do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act any fidelity from you? You have ever lived after ſuch a manner, that the moſt beſpattering Perſons could not ſuſpect your Conducts: All the World does but too well know, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of kindneſs you had for</hi> Don Henry. <hi>'Tis well enough known,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57998:125"/>what a veneration I have ever had for you; and if you would render me happy, thoſe Reproaches which you are ſo much afraid of, and which have only been the light ſuſpicion of a Malicious Perſon, would be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The Count endeavoured by theſe reaſons and all others his Wit and Paſſion could inſpire him with, to render <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> more favourable to his Paſſion, and leſs ſenſible of the Memory of <hi>Don Henry;</hi> but the auſterity of her Virtue made her inflexible: And her Siſter-in-law, who knew the Credit, Paſſion and Deſert of <hi>Souza,</hi> had all the trouble imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to obtain from her Siſter, that the Count might ſee her ſometimes; and <hi>Eugenia</hi> would not conſent to it, till he had promiſed he would ſee her but ſeldom, not ſpeak to her of love, nor make any Propoſitions of Marriage as long as her Mourning laſted. <hi>Souza</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57998:125"/>her, he ſaw her very rarely, and ſaid not a Word to her of his Paſſion. But Love knows how to make it ſelf underſtood without the help of Words, and Diſcourſes the fulleſt of kindneſs are not thoſe that are the moſt perſuaſive: Tho his Viſits were very regular, his Aſſiduities, his Cares, and all his Actions ſpoke in favour of a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his Mouth durſt not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who had refuſed to underſtand the ordinary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Love, hearkned to theſe Interpreters, without being diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and was very glad that the ſeverity of her Devoir was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by theſe little Artifices, and that the Carriage of ſo reſpectful a Lover ſtifled all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi>'s Love being ſomething reaſſured by the removal of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> he employ'd himſelf entirely to the Pretenſions that the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs had to the Throne, againſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57998:126"/>the Cabals of all aſpiring Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to that Crown: He made known to the Deputies of the States, that he would favour that Dutcheſs in all that ſhould be poſſible; he Solicited the Clergy for her; he Prayed the Nobility; Flattered the Commons; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome, threatned others, and at length made ſo many Cabals for the Dutcheſs, that part of the States declared themſelves already in Favour of her Pretenſions. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> cauſed forty thouſand Men to March to the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to joyn Force to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Artifices he had already employ'd. And that nothing might be neglected, he ſent two Perſons of great knowledge to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the Quality of Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, that they might make known the Right of his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the King and the States of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with Order however not to make any Act, by which they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57998:126"/>ſhould acknowledge the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Henry.</hi> All theſe Agents made no progreſs with him in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouation: His heart had preingaged his Mind in favour of the Dutcheſs; they in vain made Preſents and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to Perſons of Quality, and to the People for procuring their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages: The Voice of a King how feeble ſoever, has more power than the ſtrongeſt Cabals, and what is moſt difficult to other Men, is ever eaſie to Lovers.</p>
                  <p>None but the <hi>Jacobin</hi> was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of warding the blow that threatned the Pretenſions of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Dutcheſs put that entire Confidence in him, as that ſhe gave him the Letters ſhe wrote to <hi>Anthony,</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying them to him: And as ſhe one day told this Good Father, ſhe would ſend him one the next morning for that Prince, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Leonora</hi> with it the ſame day, that ſhe might cauſe that Letter to be taken from the Man,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57998:127"/>who uſed to bring them him. <hi>Leonora</hi> ſeeking all occaſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the Dutcheſs, went to find out <hi>Monis,</hi> and told him, that ſhe knew an infallible means of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his Credit with <hi>Henry,</hi> by rendring him a Signal Service; that he needed only to Way-lay one of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Servants, and take from him by force or conſent a Letter he was to carry the next morning to the <hi>Jacobin;</hi> and that if he let the King ſee it, it would procure him a Recompence above his hopes. <hi>Monis</hi> was one of thoſe Ambitious Men, who deſiring to advance themſelves at Court, employ'd all manner of means to get into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He accepted the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with joy, and found it no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult task to get that Letter out of the Mans hands, when he ſpoke to him in the Kings Name. It was very kind, and made appear Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence enough with <hi>Anthny,</hi> to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57998:127"/>reduce the King into utter deſpair. This Letter made a great noiſe at Court: Father <hi>Ferrand</hi> ſaw that the Sequels of it could not be ſafe for him. And as People of that Profeſſion are ever ready to change place, without much noiſe and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, he departed the ſame day to return into <hi>Spain:</hi> And all thoſe who were acquainted with this precipitated departure, ſancied the King not taking in good part the Advices that this Good Father gave him upon his Marriage, had Commanded him to retire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> being become deſperate with what he had learnt of the Dutcheſs, went to her Houſe in the violence of his Tranſport, and told her all that Choller can inſpire a Jealous Husband with. She endeavourd at firſt to perſuade him, that her Enemies had forg'd that Letter for the preventing the Effect of his kindneſſes. She would then, not being able to deny her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57998:128"/>own Hand Writing, make <hi>Henry</hi> believe, that ſhe had been put upon by ſurprize to write that Letter, and had been perſwaded it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to her Intereſts. But the King not reliſhing any of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and ſtill loading her with reproaches, ſhe told him very haughtily, that he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of her with Juſtice, that not having made him any promiſe, he had no right to ask her any thing; and that if ſhe had had any Complaiſance for him, he ought to be obliged to her for it, and not pretend it was an engagement in her. He would have repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her, all the Cares he had taken to cauſe her to be preferred before the other Pretenders to the Crown; he vow'd to her the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his Paſſion, and the Deſign he had taken of Marrying her; but ſhe would not ſuffer him to talk long upon that Subject. <hi>I know you would Marry me,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe him very firmly, <hi>I likewiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57998:128"/>my ſelf to give you my Hand; but you alſo know if love had begun that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion on your ſide, Policy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to Compleat it on mine, and you have too much <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Experience to believe that a Blind Love made me ſeek for this Marriage: If I have any Inclination for</hi> Anthony, <hi>I have yet much more for my Grandeur and my Devoir: If you would have made me Queen, I would have Married you, and never have ſeen him. If he could have Crowned me, I would have given him my Hand, and never liſtned to your ſiighs: I have conſidered, that the thoughts of my Grandeur requires I ſhould manage both; I thought I might without deceiving you, and without doing my ſelf an injury, have ſome Complaiſance for your Highneſs, and I fancied, my Devoir would permit me to have ſome inclination for a Prince, who ſhewed a great deal of love for me. Your thoughts deceived you,</hi> anſwered <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57998:129"/>haughtily, <hi>the Baſtard of a Prince, is but a meer Gentleman, Madam, and it it is to want Diſcretion and Reſpect, to place</hi> Anthony <hi>in your Heart under that Quality in paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with me. I never make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> reply'd the Dutcheſs to him, nettled at this Diſcourſe, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony <hi>hath-his Merit, you have yours, and I know how to do Juſtice to both. Mine ſhall not be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to that Rebel, as yours,</hi> anſwered the King, going away in a rage, <hi>and time will make appear, how much you are miſtaken in your Projects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> retir'd in the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleſt vexation he had ever been; he ſhut himſelf up for two hours in his Cloſet, without ſuffering any body to ſee him: <hi>How unhappy am I,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I have not been able to defend my heart againſt the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of</hi> Braganza? <hi>Her pretended Affection only aimed at ſeducing me, and my Age and Experience have not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57998:129"/>been able to defend me againſt her Artifices; I fancied ſhe had ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for me; and I knew not, that ſhe was only ſenſible to Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that a Man of my years, was not likely to enflame any Woman with love: Why had I the Capricious Deſign of Marrying? What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the ſevere Virtue I ever made profeſſion of? I formerly ſerved for an example to all the Kingdom, and am at preſent the Subject of its Laughter: How fatal is my Throne to me! it coſts me my Repoſe, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Liberty. What Crimes have not Ambition: and Love made me already Commit? I have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome of their Eſtates, Baniſhed others; I perſecute my Nephew with Gruelty; I fruſtrate the Rights of all thoſe who pretend to the Crown, and all this in favour of an ungrateful Woman, who deſpiſes me, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices me to a Rival. I muſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that Perfidious Woman, ſee her no more, and recall into my heart
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57998:130"/>the Virtue that I have Baniſhed thence: Alas! it rendred me happy and peaceable, and I am at preſent the moſt unfortunate of all Men.</hi> It was by theſe and ſuch other like Reflexions, that <hi>Henry</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Exhale his Grief, and Cure his Love; he ceaſed ſeeing the Dutcheſs, and no longer favoured her Pretenſions. He reſolved to give to the Right of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the Suffrages and Cares he had done to the Pretenſions of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Braganza.</hi> He propoſed to the States, to Name <hi>Philip</hi> for his Succeſſour; but as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> have ever been Enemies to the Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> that Propoſition was not kindly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſend Forces upon the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Theſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Preparations alarmed all the Neighbouring Princes: The Pope being willing to take advantage of that occaſion, to become Arbitrator
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57998:130"/>of the Chriſtian Princes, cauſed his Mediation to be offered to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> for the pacifying mutters, and reconciling thoſe differences. But the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Submiſſive to the Pope as he was Fixed to his Intereſts, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his Offers, he made his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> he likewiſe accepted them in General terms; he was too much a Politician open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to refuſe that Mediation; but not being willing to give New Examples to Chriſtian Princes of acknowledging the Apoſtolick See for the Judge of Kingdoms, he ſpun things out to length, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any Poſitive anſwer to his Holineſſes <hi>Nuncio;</hi> and when he could no longer excuſe making Reply, he told him, that the Juſtice of his Pretenſions were ſo well grounded, and ſo manifeſt, that there was no occaſion for a Mediator in that Affair; that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was too well intentioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57998:131"/>him, and the States of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> did ſufficiently acknowledge his Right: However, that if any Change happened in Affairs, and it grew neceſſary to chooſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratour of that Difference, he would not fail to have recourſe to the Holy Father, as to the Refuge and Judge of all true Chriſtians, and to make uſe in that occaſion of his Holineſſes Zeal.</p>
                  <p>During all theſe Negotiations, <hi>Henry</hi> whom Age and Truobles had very much weakned, fell Sick, and died about four days after, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the Arms of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who was reconciled to him, but had however employ'd all her Addreſs in vain to perſuade him to make her Succeed in the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> by his Will. They had not yet had time to think of the Funerals of this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, when four Deputies from the Iſles of <hi>Terceras,</hi> came to Court to Inform that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57998:131"/>newly Landed in their Iſland, and was lodged in the Convent of the <hi>Cordeliers:</hi> That he was Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Served, and that thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious had borrowed the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Moveables they could find in that Country, and a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Plate for his uſe. Theſe News excited New Troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People, and new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms in the Minds of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Souza</hi> was ſent into thoſe Iſlands with two Deputies from the Governours of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie all theſe things; and the Count had the joy before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, to learn from the Mouth of <hi>Eugenia</hi> her ſelf, that he ſhould find her leſs ſevere at his return, and ſhe would permit him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Marriage to her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He departed with theſe hopes, his Voyage was not long; he learnt as ſoon as he was arriv'd at the Iſles of <hi>Terceras,</hi> that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was gone from thence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57998:132"/>
                     <hi>incognito</hi> the Night before; that he would not ſuffer any one to attend him, nor make known to what place he deſigned to go. The <hi>Envoys</hi> who were with <hi>Souza,</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Religious, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the King, if they had heard no talk of <hi>Don Henry?</hi> They aſſured them, that he was killed in Battel. The <hi>Envoys</hi> returned to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> after having to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe made exact enquiry after the King: They aſſured <hi>Eugenia</hi> and all her Relations of <hi>Don Henry</hi>'s death: That Widow was out of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Her Relations and her Friends knowing the Merit and Birth of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> preſſed her with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conclude that Match, that ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be vanquiſhed by the Counts Conſtancy, and the deſires of all his acquaintance. This Marriage was accompliſhed with great ſatisfaction on both parts. And nothing had been comparable to the Count of <hi>Souza</hi>'s happineſs, if its continuance had been equal to its Charms.</p>

                     <hi>Anthony</hi> made ſtill new efforts to mount the Throne, and to Marry the Dutcheſs, and his love enflamed his Ambition. He was Elected for the Defendour of the Publick Liberty in ſome Cities; he cauſed himſelf to be Proclaimed King in others, and having drawn together ſome few Troops, he Marched towards <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they would have refuſed to let him in. But the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> and her Friends, augmenting the diſorder that the approach of thoſe Forces cauſed in the City, <hi>Anthony</hi> entred it without much reſiſtance, and cauſed himſelf to be Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King by main Force. The Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who Commanded the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces, being entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſeized all the Cities he met with in his paſſage: The Pope hearing of the Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to, ſet Cardinal <hi>Alexander Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> as his Legate to <hi>Philip.</hi> This
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57998:133"/>King having notice thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that beſides the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Title of Peace maker of Chriſtendom would bring to the Apoſtolick See, the Pope would make a Vaſſal of him who ſhould be Crowned by his Arbitrage. He reſolved to take Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> before the Popes Legate could arrive in <hi>Spain:</hi> He ſent to the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> to advance his Conqueſts with all poſſible Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Gave Order, that in all places in his Dominions, through which the Legate was to paſs, they ſhould detain him there as long as they could, he pretended to be Sick, and ſent word to the Legate, when near <hi>Badage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57998:133"/>deny; but he handſomely declined the Popes Mediation, and told his Legate, that Affairs were too far advanced by Arms, that very few Cities remained for him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and all Kings would repute as weakneſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he ſhould have for his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After this Civil refuſal the Legate would have had his Audience of leave to have gone into <hi>Portugal,</hi> in purſuance of his Orders from the Holy See: But <hi>Philip,</hi> fearing that <hi>Anthony</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> whom the Pope ſeemed to favour, might draw ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the Legates preſence, would not conſent to his departure before he had made his Entry in Form.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Publick Calamities, no body was happy but the Count <hi>de Souza;</hi> and yet it may be ſaid, that the Zeal he had for the State hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from reliſhing perfectly the delights of his Marriage. He
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57998:134"/>was not born for the Pleaſures of Love, and as he was one day talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amorouſly with <hi>Eugenia,</hi> he was told that a Merchant who came from <hi>Africa,</hi> asked to ſpeak with him; <hi>Souza</hi> troubled at this News, without knowing any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; all <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s Blood was fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, without being able to tell why, and the Merchant being brought in told <hi>Eugenia,</hi> that he had lately ſeen <hi>Don Henry:</hi> She fainted away at that Name. <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> in an extream Surprize, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Merchant, <hi>that what he ſaid was falſe, that</hi> Don Henry <hi>was killed in the Battel of</hi> Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian, <hi>and that all the News they had received from</hi> Africa, <hi>had but too well confirmed his death. All the World believed it, my Lord,</hi> anſwered the Merchant, <hi>becauſe</hi> Don Henry <hi>was not ſeen amongſt the other Captives, and</hi> Hamet <hi>for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and ſecret Deſigns, cauſed Perſons of the greateſt Confideration,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57998:134"/>who had been taken in that War, to be drawn out from amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Priſoners, and concealed apart in unknown Places. The Africans ſet on foot the rumours of their Deaths among the Portugal Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> Don Henry <hi>was of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and as theſe ſecret Priſoners have at preſent ſomething more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he found the means of ſeeing me the day before my departure, and deſired me to go find out</hi> Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>at</hi> Lisbon, <hi>and deſire her from him, to uſe her endeavours to free him out of ſo long a Captivity. Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> asked the Merchant why <hi>Don Henry</hi> did not write: The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant anſwered, <hi>becauſe he wanted the means of doing it, and was only able to ſay to him four Words.</hi> The Count not knowing what Credit to give to the Words of this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, ſeeing on the one ſide great appearance of Truth, and wiſhing on the other that it were all Falſe, found an expedient to get out of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57998:135"/>that uncertainty; and after having taken care to recover <hi>Eugenia</hi> out of her Swoon, and given Order to her Maids to get her to Bed; he led that Merchant into a Gallery of his Houſe, where <hi>Don Henry</hi>'s Picture hung amongſt ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pieces which that Gallery was Adorned with. <hi>I ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Souza</hi> to him, <hi>except you diſcover amongſt theſe Pieces, the Pourtraict of</hi> Don Henry, <hi>whom you ſay, you lately ſpoke to:</hi> The Merchant would have at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted himſelf from that Tryal, and told <hi>Souza, that the Troubles</hi> Don Henry <hi>had ſuffered in his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, might have ſo changed him, that he did not reſemble what he was formerly:</hi> However having caſt his Eyes upon his Picture, he knew him again immediately, and cryed: <hi>Ah! my Lord, there's</hi> Don Henry<hi>'s Portraict, and his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have not changed his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe words quite ruined <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za;</hi> he had till that moment queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his unhappineſs; but when he ſaw this Merchant knew that Portraict to be <hi>Don Henry</hi>'s Picture, he had no hopes left him. He was penetrated with all the grief that a Lover can be ſenſible of, when his beloved Object is forced from him, and he deprived of the delights of a perfect Love: <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s Beauties, and the Pleaſures he had enjoy'd with her came crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Mind. The <hi>Idea</hi> of ſo many Charms raiſing the value of the happineſs he had poſſeſſed, made him know the greatneſs of the loſs he was going to have, and made his grief exceſſively ſtinging. This Blow, and thoſe firſt Reflexions rendred him at firſt motionleſs; then walking apace ſome moments in that Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he told the Merchant, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething recovered from his diſorder, <hi>That he ſaw a great many
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57998:136"/>Difficulties in what he now informed him of, that he would ſend into</hi> Africa <hi>to know the Truth of that Affair, and deſired him on his ſide to make uſe of the Correſpondence he had in that Country for the procuring more certain proofs of</hi> Don Henry's <hi>being ſtill alive.</hi> The Merchant promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to procure thoſe Informations; and <hi>Souza</hi> returned to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> whom they had put to Bed, and who did not remember the News that had ſo much ſurprized her, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſo long a Swoon. <hi>What ailes you, My Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, ſeeing him oppreſſed with grief, <hi>muſt my fainting needs make you ſo very ſad? or has ſome accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to you, that we have reaſon to deplore? Ah!

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57998:136"/>alive, and you are my Husband Eugenia</hi> could not reſiſt the anguiſh that this Reflexion oppreſt her with; ſhe fell again into a Swoon; <hi>Souza</hi> was not in a condition to relieve her, and her Women had all the pains imaginable to recover her out of it. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, when ſhe had recovered the uſe of her Senſes, and he had ſent all thoſe out who were in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>you muſt not abandon your ſelf to Grief; perhaps this News is not true, the Merchant who brought it us, could give no proofs of it, and you know that a thouſand ſuch falſe reports ran abroad of all thoſe who periſhed in that Battel. No, no,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, Don Henry <hi>is living, he is living, he is my Husband, and I am Married to you.</hi> Her tears and her ſighs hindred her for ſome moments, and repeating from time to time, Don Henry <hi>is living, and I am Married again;</hi> Don Henry <hi>is living and you are my Husband;</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57998:137"/>ſhe abandoned her ſelf to ſuch a Deſpair as deprived her of her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. She thought it Criminal to look upon <hi>Souza;</hi> ſhe durſt not pronounce his Name; ſhe could not think without horrour of the Engagements they had made. <hi>How unhappy am I, or rather, how guilty, my Lord, ſpare me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſeeing you,</hi> ſaid ſhe to <hi>Souza, begon from hence, never ſee me more, I can no longer ſuffer your Preſence.</hi> She had hardly finiſhed theſe Words, than that ſhe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called them: What ſhe was to <hi>Souza,</hi> what he had done for her, returned into her thoughts, and fearing ſhe had failed in the reſpect ſhe owed ſo good a Husband, ſhe would have repared that fault by ſome kindneſs, but the remembrance of <hi>Don Henry</hi> reproached her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with that tender motion, as if it had been the greateſt of Crimes. <hi>Yes, Madam, I muſt leave you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Souza</hi> to her, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57998:137"/>recovered from his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>the delights of love are no part of my fate. It is not the will of Heaven that I find my happineſs here below; I ſhould have believed it perfect might I have been beloved by you, and tho my grief be never ſo great, I muſt renounce it for ever. Do but form to your ſelf all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that this ſeparation gives me, Madam? My Lord, I feell their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as much as you do,</hi> anſwered <hi>Eugenia, who could not forbear melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into tears. Your love is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from mine,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>and I have occaſion for more Conſtancy than you; regulate yours according to mine; let us both endeavour to free</hi> Don Henry, <hi>who is no leſs to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than we: He will comfort you for the loſs of me, and nothing can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me for yours.</hi>

                  <p>While <hi>Eugenia</hi> and <hi>Souza</hi> deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their particular misfortunes, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> lamented the Publick diſtreſſes. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57998:138"/>all about <hi>Lishon: Anthony</hi> was fled under a Diſguiſed habit, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> was retired to <hi>Villa Bohen.

                     <hi>Portugal: Almeida</hi> led a private and ſolitary life at <hi>Venice,</hi> and would not hearken to the vows of any Lover ſince ſhe had loſt <hi>Don Sebaſtian:</hi> She often deplored the misfortunes ſhe was the cauſe of, and as ſhe was one day all alone in her Chamber, thinking of the ſeveral accidents of her life, ſhe was told, that a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Gentleman asked to ſpeak with her. She cauſed him to come in; but how great was her ſurprize at the ſight of that <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze?</hi> ſhe gave a great ſhrick, and retired in a fright. <hi>How Princeſs,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Portugal</hi> to her, <hi>does</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>make you afraid? Ah Heavens, is it you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languiſhingly towards that Stranger, <hi>is it your Shade that comes to comfort me, or renew my Griefs?

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57998:139"/>told the Maids that came to help her, that ſhe would be alone; and when they were withdrawn, <hi>May, I aſſure my ſelf,</hi> ſaid ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>that I ſee</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>once again, and his Death that I ſo much bewailed, and the News of which has for ſo long a time been ſpread through all the World, ſhould it not be real? No,</hi> reply'd ſhe immediately, Don Sebaſtian <hi>died in my Quarrel,</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope <hi>and</hi> Africa <hi>knew it, I am but too certain it is ſo, and I cannot give tears enough to his death: Impoſtor, leave me to deplore what you cannot reſtore me. No, my Princeſs,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, caſting himſelf at her Knees, and kiſſing her Hand a thouſand times, that ſhe had not the force to take away; <hi>I am no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, I am that</hi> Don Sebaſtian, <hi>who am come to dry up the Tears you honour his loſs with, and who redemands the affection that you have promiſed him. If you do not know again my Shape, my Voice, and

Since you will not put off this recital till a more Convenient time,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> to her, and taking a Seat, <hi>I will give you an account

                  <q>
                     <p>You have learnt without doubt, how baſely all thoſe, who were ranged under my Standard, to fight on the day of Battel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned me, when Fire was ſet on our Amunition: I found my ſelf alone in the midſt of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who attacqued me on all ſides: I fought a long time againſt a great number, and I reſolved rather to loſe my life, than be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner; but the Wound I had received in my Right-ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being unbound in the heat of the Fight, the Blood I loſt thro that Wound, ſo weakned my Arm, that I could no longer lift it up to defend my ſelf: I ſought with my Left Arm, till that wearied with ſo many Efforts, I fell almoſt without life, amongſt the Bodies of the Enemies I had Slain. Some Troopers of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57998:140"/>Regiment of <hi>Mulei Magdelec,</hi> a Prince of the Blood Royal of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> having ſeen me fall, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded me, to ſtrip me of my Cloaths; and as the firſt, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me, was in my reach, I run my Sword through his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and made him fall dead by me: The others irritated at their Companions death, would not have left me long alive, if they had not found it more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to make me their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than deprive me of life. They drew me from that place into a little Wood near <hi>Tamiſta;</hi> that violence, and the fatigues I had ſuffered, making me faint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they could not recover me in a long time. I had laid aſide in the danger I ran, the marks that might have diſcovered my Quality. But my Armour made thoſe People judge I was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſon; ſome of them fell to Diſputing with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57998:141"/>the gain they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to from this Prize; others pretended to have the better ſhare in it, becauſe they had firſt laid hands on me; and not being able to agree about their ſhares, ſeveral of them reſolved to kill me, when <hi>Abdeliza, Magdelec</hi>'s Siſter, who being informed, that her Brother was dead, whom ſhe tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, came all in tears at the Head of thirty Troopers, in the place where we were, and demanded of the Men that held me, whom ſhe ſaw to be of her Brothers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, what was become of him: They aſſured her, that he had not been ſo much as wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Lieutenant being killed by a Muſquet Bullet, and falling down at his Feet, it was believed, that it had been <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec,</hi> who had been killed by that ſhot. <hi>Abdeliza</hi> caſt her Eyes upon me, the ſtate I was in, raiſed her
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57998:141"/>pity, and after having learnt by ſome other particulars, that her brother was living, ſhe asked thoſe Troopers who I was, if I was ſtill alive, and why they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, with ſo much Crnelty, a Man who could not defend himſelf. They told her, to animate her to my ruine, that I had kill'd above twenty of their Companions; that I was only in a Swoon: But this Diſcourſe, far from inſpiring her with any hatred to me, as thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> had promiſed themſelves, ſhe had an admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an eſteem for my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Commanded them to treat me more gently. She Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me more ſtrictly: Kings ever wear certain Characters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Faces, that make them diſtinguiſhed from other Men: ſhe knew I was no Common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the pity ſhe took of my Fate, being joyned to the eſteem ſhe had already conceived for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57998:142"/>me, gave birth in her Heart to ſome tender Motions, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed her in my misfortunes. She perceived that I loſt all my Blood, and Commanded they ſhould bind up my wounds, and I received help, by her Order, even from thoſe who would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of life.</p>
                     <p>When I recovered out of my Swoon, I was ſurpriz'd to meet with ſo charitable hands, which were zealous to give me eaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Enemies, who before would have deſtroyed me; but my ſurprize became much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when I ſaw in the midſt of all thoſe People, a Woman who ſet them at work, and who appeared by her Habit and Air, to be a Perſon of a high Rank. <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec</hi> happened to come into the ſame place, as I was attentive to all theſe things. He had been told the diſquiets and ardour with which his Siſter ſought for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57998:142"/>him. <hi>Brother,</hi> ſaid ſhe, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Embraced him, and ſhewn him the joy ſhe had for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>Brother, the ſtate this wretch is in, has raiſed my Compaſſion: I beg you would grant me this Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I will take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your Men for that loſs. Magdelec</hi> was called away by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cares, he did not ſtay to look upon me, and gave me to his Siſter, who cauſed me to be carried to her Palace, and had a particular care of me during all the time I was conſtrained to keep my Bed. I got up as ſoon as I found I had a little Strength, I cauſed my ſelf to be led to <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliza</hi>'s Appartment, and made her a thouſand acknowledgments for her Favours. She anſwered me very obligingly, and told me, that the Noble and Great Air ſhe had obſerved in my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had obliged her to Succour me; that ſhe had conceived a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57998:143"/>great eſteem for me at firſt, and did not doubt, but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, I would anſwer as I ought, ſo many good Sentiments. She ſpoke theſe words with a great deal of goodneſs, but with a certain Air of Haughtineſs, that made me know ſhe knew not who I was: I anſwered her with all poſſible Submiſſion, to keep her in her Errour. She would know who I was; I told her, that I was a Volunteer of an Illuſtrious Extraction, and I acted my part ſo well, notwithſtanding all the Queſtions ſhe asked me upon that point, that ſhe did not at all ſuſpect I was the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I quickly perceived, that the cares ſhe took in my Favour, ſurpaſſed ordinary kindneſſes, ſhe did not long conceal from me her Sentiments. She believed her ſelf to be of that Rank and Merit, as I ſhould look upon her Paſſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57998:143"/>as an honour: She made me a ſincere Confeſſion of it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me a Conſiderable Fortune if I was not ungrateful to her kindneſſes. Pardon, dear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, <hi>ſaid</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>to</hi> Almei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, if I ſeem'd to have ſome kindneſs for her: The ſtate I was in reduced to, and the deſire I had of ſeeing you again, obliged me to that fiction: My Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances abuſed her; I did out of policy, all that I could have done out of Love.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ah! how afraid am I, Sir,</hi> interrupted <hi>Almeida, you loved that Princeſs? I know her, ſhe is young, ſhe is tender, ſhe has Wit; and though of the Colour of the</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, <hi>her Face is not without Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Don Sebaſtian</hi> vowed he had never loved her, and remov'd her ſuſpicions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>What kindneſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, purſued he, that <hi>Abdaliza</hi> had for me, my Priſon was not the leſs rigorous: That Princeſs did not believe that ſhe had chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57998:144"/>me ſo faſt as that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the aſſurance of the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhe had given me, and the more Paſſion ſhe had for me; the more afraid ſhe was to loſe me; and I was obſerved and kept ſo ſtrict, that I could not give any notice of my Captivity.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I learnt that the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> ſought for me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, that they had asked leave of <hi>Hamet</hi> to ſearch amongſt the dead and wounded, to ſee if they could find me. <hi>Hamet</hi> likewiſe fearing ſome ſurprize on my part, and being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be fully informed of my fate, made ſtrict inquiries thro all the Army. Some reported I was Drowned in the River of <hi>Meucaſen</hi> as I fled away; but he had ſeen me fight, and could not perſuade himſelf, I could be capable of running. Some of 'em again ſaid, that I muſt needs be unknown amongſt the Common
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57998:144"/>Priſoners; and others aſſured, that they had ſeen ſome Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſeiſe me, and they muſt needs have taken away my life. <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liza</hi> was at the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s when theſe accounts were given: Theſe laſt words filled her full of fear and joy; ſhe could have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Priſoner was a King; but ſhe feared he ſhould be taken from her under that Title. She had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commended at Court, the Wit and Gracefulneſs of her Priſoner; which ſometimes made them railly her; and <hi>Hamet</hi> turning towards her: Do not you detain the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in your Chains, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he to her ſmiling, and is it not to that Quality you have given ſo high an eſteem? <hi>Abdeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> bluſhed at this Diſcourſe, and her Confuſion confirmed the King in that Opinion. He was afraid I ſhould eſcape him, and told that Princeſs, taking her by the hand: Let us go ſee that Illuſtrious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57998:145"/>Madam, whom your eſteem renders worthy of a Throne, if he be not already a King. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> came to <hi>Abdeliza</hi>'s Palace, I was brought before him, judge what a Confuſion it was to ſuch a heart as mine: I had never till then been ſenſible of the ſhame of my Captivity; I had only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before a Woman, who loved me, and knew me not; but when I ſaw <hi>Hamet,</hi> and that he knew me, Rage and Deſpair ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Soul; and I ſpoke to him with ſo much Haughtineſs, that he immediately Commanded, I ſhould be loaded with Irons, and be dragged to the Tower of the Old Caſtle. 'Twas in vain that <hi>Abdeliza</hi> caſt her ſelf at his Feet, and ſhed tears; I was forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from that Place, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Tower, where no Body durſt approach within a hundred Paces.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57998:145"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hamet</hi> judged that the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which had been ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of my death, might be of advantage to his Deſigns, ſo that he would not undeceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And as he was followed but by very few Courtiers when he went to <hi>Abdeliza</hi>'s, he fancied he might eaſily hinder what paſſed there from being known. He forbade all thoſe who attended him, to ſpeak of my being alive, upon pain of Death, and likewiſe flattered that Princeſs to oblige her to keep ſilence. However when a Month was near paſſed ſince the day of my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe had leave to ſee me. She came thither accompanied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by one of her Women, and told me, after having drawn me aſide, How little ſenſible are you of my kindneſs, Sir, and how Cruel are you to your ſelf, to have ſo obſtinately concealed from me your Quality? You
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57998:146"/>ſhould have been perhaps at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Peace in your own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and you are inſtead of that in cares and in troubles. I have ever been very ſenſible of your Favours, Madam, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> and I was deſirour to ſee their Effects continue, but was afraid that a Confeſſion of what I was might have interrupted their Courſe: Pardon that fear, Madam, 'tis the ſole Motion of my heart, that you were not Miſtreſs of, and you ſee I endure a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penance for it. She aſſured me, ſhe would think of the means to deliver me: I prayed her to make it known in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> that I was alive; without daring to ſpeak of you for fear of diſpleaſing her: But theſe Advices were too contrary to her and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Deſigns, to employ her ſelf for the making them known: She feared I ſhould eſcape her, if I was delivered by any other than
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57998:146"/>her ſelf. She came to ſee me as often as they would give her leave, and ever gave me ſome new hopes of recovering my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Magdelec</hi> perceived the love his Siſter had for me; he ſpoke to her of it, and ſhe did not deny it; as he tenderly loved her, and as that Paſſion was not unbecoming her, he endeavoured to ſecond her Deſigns. He told <hi>Hamet,</hi> when he had learnt the Conqueſts the King of <hi>Spain</hi> made in my Territories, that he ought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that growth of Power: That there was a great kindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Abdeliza</hi> and me; that this Buſineſs might be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his State, and that if they could make me conſent to Marry that Princeſs, the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King would be ſure of me by this Match, and might make uſe of my Right and Power againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and place me at the Head of ſome Troops for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57998:147"/>the ſtopping his Projects. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> ſeemed to reliſh theſe reaſons; but he had ſecret Engagements with <hi>Spain,</hi> that hindered him from acting openly: Then <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delec,</hi> who ardently deſired to place his Siſter upon a Throne, told her that the King Conſented to their Projects; that he would grant me both Liberty and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if I would Marry her, and that ſhe needed only to make me thoſe Propoſitions. She came to ſee me, and ſounded me upon the point. The Love I had for you, and the Faith I had promiſed you, my Princeſs, <hi>purſued he, addreſſing himſelf to</hi> Almeida, were too powerful over my Mind to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſuch like Propoſitions: My Captivity and the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances I owed <hi>Abdeliza,</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hinder me from denying them roughly; and nor thinking fit either to reject or receive 'em, I told her that a Match made in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57998:147"/>Chains would become neither her nor me, and the Conſequences of it could not be promiſing; that ſhe ought to be ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of my acknowledgments, as to believe I ſhould never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her, though I were at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that if ſhe could procure me that advantage, and my return into my Dominions, ſhe ſhould be abſolute Miſtreſs of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. She ſometimes let her ſelf be moved with theſe weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but Suſpicion and Jealouſie ſeizing her on a ſuddain, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me as ungrateful and perfidious; that I had never loved her, and that the tendereſt Motions of my heart were for her who had cauſed me ſo many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: Go periſh then, Cruel Man, ſaid ſhe, at parting, in the ſlavery you refule to be delivered out of. <hi>Almeida</hi> ſighed at thoſe words, and could not forbear ſhedding tears at at that reflexion. Ceaſe to bewaile
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57998:148"/>misfortunes, for which I am but too well rewarded, Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Don Sebaſtian, <hi>ſeeing her Tears tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle down her Face,</hi> and let the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Relation procure me Pardon for the trouble my indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion has newly given you.</p>
                     <p>Her vexation encreaſed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of my Priſon, <hi>continued</hi> Don Sebaſtian; the more ſhe was enraged, the worſe was I Treated: I was oppreſt with a thouſand different troubles; I ſuffered all the ills of the ſevereſt Impriſonment; I had all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and concern that a King who loves his People can be capable of, when he has cauſed the ruine of his State. But what lay more heavy upon my heart than all this, was the grief of being abſent from you, and not to know what was become of you. I ſometimes had a Deſign of giving ſome hopes to <hi>Abdeliza,</hi> that the rigours of my Priſon might be abated and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57998:148"/>her to endeavour the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing my Liberty. But what Reſolution ſoever I had taken, I could not conſtrain my ſelf to make her any promiſe, contrary to the fidelity I had vow'd to you, and all my endeavours did only ſerve to make her the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark how conſtrained and forced all my kindneſſes to her was. Tho the refuſals I had made of Marrying <hi>Abdeliza</hi> had ever been coloured with ſome reaſon, and attended with kindneſſes; they however brought her into deſpair. She vow'd every time ſhe left me, ſhe would never ſee me more, and yet ſtill returned. Sometimes ſhe would make me the bittereſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and in an inſtant after load me with Careſſes; I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flattered my ſelf with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that in the different Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which agitated her, had ſhe been abſolute Miſtreſs of my Fate, ſhe would have ſet me at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57998:149"/>notwithſtanding her vexation and my refuſals; which I was ſure of one day, when after having made me the higheſt Reproaches as her Cuſtom was, ſhe told me with the moſt paſſionate Air imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Well Cruel Man, be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my Paſſion, ſince you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but do not hinder me at leaſt from loving you, and do not oppoſe my endeavours. Doſt thou love thy Priſon better than thy Throne? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you make ſome attempts to ſecond my deſires? Thy Kingdom and my Kindneſſes are not they worth thy diſſembling for ſome moments; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to love me, promiſe to Marry me; deceive me, I conſent to it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided thou delivereſt thy ſelf out of Slavery, and flattereſt but my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> I own I was moved at this Diſcourſe, and her ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring to be deceived would have hindred me, though I could have been capable of abuſing her. No, Princeſs, ſaid I to her, the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57998:149"/>pains you take in my favour, and the Tenderneſs you have for me, ought to be otherwiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed than by Fiction. I cannot conſent to deceive any Body, and leſs you than any one ſoever: I have for you all the tendereſt acknowledgment that a heart can be capable of; I have no repugnance for the Match you propoſe to me; but I am born free, and I have ſeen my ſelf a King; I cannot ſuffer to be conſtrained; and your forcing me to love, is enough to make me hate, ſet me at Liberty and promiſe your ſelf all things from my Acknowledgments. Well, Sir, <hi>anſwered ſhe,</hi> I muſt endeavour to ſatisfie you; I muſt Solicite your freedom, tho you flie from me, and make me paſs the reſt of my Days in the affliction of not ſeeing you. Having ſaid theſe words, ſhe left me, and gave me reaſon to believe ſhe would do all that was poſſible, to procure
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57998:150"/>me my Liberty, without exacting any of the Conditions ſhe had propoſed to me. She came to tell me ſome days after, that ſhe had made very preſſing Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for my Libery; that the King had at length conſented to my enlargment; and that he had only asked eight days to take meaſures in that Affair; that this time being expired, I ſhould be no longer in ſo ſtrict a Priſon, and I might then write, and ſpeak, and do all that was neceſſary for the procuring my Ranſom. You ſhall be free as you deſired, ſaid ſhe to me ſighing, and you may leave me and forget me too, if you will, without fearing my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches or my preſence, which I have ſo often wearied you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. This News gave me all the joy I was capable of in my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. I kiſſed <hi>Abdeliza</hi>'s hands a thouſand times, and aſſured her I ſhould never forget her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: However, ſhe told me
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57998:150"/>languiſhingly, you will aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and quit me with all the joy a heart can be capable of. You already feell the Motions of it, and cannot deny them. You never was ſo kind, nor I more Charm'd, and Tranſported with the delight of it; and yet, alas! you never gave me ſo many marks of your averſion. I eaſily perceived, I had ſeem'd too much pleas'd. I was ſorry, and uſed my endeavours to perſuade her, that this joy had no other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than Liberty, and I was at firſt ſo tranſported with thoſe hopes, that I was not able to conſider the Conſequences. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured her as well as I could. I wiped of the Tears which trickled from her Eyes. I deſired her to ſend Letters into <hi>Portugal</hi> in my name, being they would neither give me leave to write, or ſuffer me to have either Paper or Pens, which ſhe promiſed me to do, and did indeed write thither: But I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57998:151"/>have been ſince informed, that all the Letters were Intercepted, and no Paſſage was given to any News of me into my Dominions.</p>
                     <p>You may judge with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience I waited till the term was expired, when my Slavery was to end, and what a delight it was to me to fancy, I ſhould return to you. But the eight days were not yet at an end when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs came to me, and told me with a great deal of Grief, that her Brother enraged at my Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, had diſſuaded the King from ſending me back; that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to underſtand, that I had rendred my ſelf unworthy of that Favour, by deſpiſing to Alie my my ſelf to his Blood; and that as long as he detain'd me in his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſhould ſerve for an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage to him againſt the Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and againſt the Riſings of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</hi> Theſe Reaſons, ſaid ſhe to me, have been too hard for my
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57998:151"/>Prayers, and the King has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to tell you for the laſt time, that our Marriage was the only means that could reſtore you to your Liberty. Well, Madam, if there are no other means to become free, anſwered I her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, I muſt reſolve to die in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. That is too much, reply'd ſhe to me in a Tranſport, your obſtinacy proceeds even to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; do you think that what I ſay is only an Artifice of my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Can you be ignorant of what I have done for you, Cruel Man as you are? If I had not lov'd you more than my ſelf, would I have Solicited your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement? Who oblig'd me to do that violence to my ſelf? I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her with the little love ſhe had for me; that ſhe ſhould never make me conſent to our Union by that conſtraint; that ſhe onght to be well enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Delicacy of my
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57998:152"/>

                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57998:153"/>Virtue in that point; and that in fine, if I did not recover my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by her means, I ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe, ſhe alone detained me in Priſon, and this thought would quickly cauſe my Death. In ſhort, I ſo moved and perſuaded her, that ſhe aſſured me at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe would loſe her life, but ſhe would procure my Liberty, and when ſhe ſaw me again, it ſhould be to bring me News of my Delivery.</p>
                     <p>And indeed I was near fifteen days without ſeeing her, and was aſtoniſhed, that one Evening very late ſhe came into my Chamber, accompanied with the Keeper of the Tower I was in, and bid me ſoftly be ready the next morning very early, and follow with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence the Perſon, who ſhould ſhew me her Cyphers. I durſt not return her thanks for fear of being heard by the Keeper, ſhe withdrew, and I paſſed the Night
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57998:153"/>in ſuch an uncertainty, that it was as tireſome as my troubles, not being able to perſuade my ſelf, that <hi>Abdeliza</hi> would favour my Eſcape. As ſoon as the day began to appear a <hi>Renegado</hi> entred my Chamber, and took off my Irons, telling me, You are free, Sir, if you will but follow me. I promiſed to Reward Nobly this good Office, and followed him. We went down into the Ditch of the Caſtle by Ladders and Ropes which were prepared for that purpoſe, and paſſing under the Port-Cullis, we entred into a little Sandy Sink, that the Sea fills when the Tyde comes in, but it having been two hours Ebb, it had left dry. This Sink brought us in leſs than a quarter of an hour to a great Road, where we found a Man waiting for us with two Horſes. I mounted one, and my Guide another. We came in leſs than two hours upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57998:154"/>where I found with a great deal of Grief and amazement, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliza</hi> in a Chriſtian Habit, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving order for the fitting of a Ship, ſhe had prepared for us. Well, Sir, ſaid ſhe accoſting me, will you believe that I conſtrain you at preſent, and will you have as much averſion for <hi>Abdeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in a Chriſtian Habit, as in the Dreſs of an <hi>African?</hi> Madam, I am ſo Confuſed, as I cannot make you an anſwer, reply'd I, let us think of getting from this Shore, and we will ſee afterwards what is to be done.</p>
                     <p>I had hardly finiſhed theſe Words, than <hi>Magdalec</hi> appeared upon the Sea ſhore at the Head of Sixty Troopers. <hi>Abdeliza</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out to hoiſt up Soils; but the Ship was ſtill at Anchor, and not one of the Seamen durſt offer to weigh it. Hearing <hi>Magdalec</hi>'s Voice they went in their Boat to bring him him on Board.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57998:154"/>Some of them Seized <hi>Abdeliza,</hi> who would have caſt her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. Others fell upon me, without knowing me, and I was hurried back to Priſon, without knowing what was become of that unfortunate Princeſs. What ſad Reflexions was I loaded withal in that Place! The hopes I had of being ſuddenly at Liberty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced the afflictions of my Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: I fancied, that after ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an attempt, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have again the opportunity to eſcape. They kept me ever in ſight: I no longer ſaw <hi>Abdeliza;</hi> no one Comforted me in my misfortunes, and I had no hopes left of getting out. I ſometimes feared, that the Crueltie of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> might cauſe that Princeſs to to be put to Death; I repented my having ſo little Complaiſance for her, I reproached my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly for being the cauſe of her mifortune: All theſe thoughts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57998:155"/>put me into mortal Agonies, and yet it was not theſe that were the moſt ſenſible, when I conſider'd on the horrour of being ſeparated from my Dear <hi>Almeida,</hi> when I thought of your Charms, when I made Reflexion on the Delights we enjoy'd at the beginning of our Love, when I figured to my ſelf the mortal diſquiets you would be in, hearing no Tydings of me; when I conſidered, that I could not learn any thing of you, and that you were perhaps dead of Grief, Deſpair ſeized my Soul, and made me loſe my Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>However, as in the greateſt misfortunes there ever remains ſome glimpſe of hopes, which ſeems only to ſupport us for the prolonging our ſufferings; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the kindneſſes of <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liza,</hi> the power ſhe had over her Brother, the Credit he had at the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and told my ſelf, that while ſhe was living, I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57998:155"/>ought not deſpair of my ſafety. I one day ventured to ask my Keeper, what was become of that Princeſs: She is dead, ſaid he to me ſurlily, and you'll undergo the ſame Fate very ſuddenly. Death will never afright me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, if it only aims at me. But I ſhould be extreamly griev'd if I had been the cauſe of her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Then you are never to be Comforted, reply'd he, ſhe died for the Love of you. I Conjured this Keeper by all that I fancied had the moſt power over him, to make me a faithful recital of all had happened to <hi>Abdeliza.</hi> I could learn nothing, but what he had already told me, and he would no longer hear me, nor ſpeak to me. I had an extream regret for her loſs; I had all the Grief I could have been ſenſible of for her Death, if I had really lov'd her: Pity, Acknowledgment, my own Intereſt, and my Remorſes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57998:156"/>met all in my Mind to torment me, and never was Grief equal to that I groaned under in my Priſon after this Information. About the ſame time I was told, that <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delec</hi> ſuppoſing I had Seduced his Siſter; and juſtly irritated againſt her Enterprize would puniſh me by a very rigorous ſort of Death. I prepared my ſelf for all, that the Crueltie of thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> could make me ſuffer, and Death ſeemed to me, the mildeſt puniſhment that could happen to me. And in truth, I have been ſince acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Magdelec</hi> employ'd all the Credit he had with the King, to put me to Death, and <hi>Hamet</hi> had even conſented to Sign the Bill; but that his Counſel had not judged it for his Intereſt to take away my life, and the poſture which the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were in, they fancied I ſhould not be unuſeful to the King of <hi>Morocco.</hi>

                     <p>I had been neer a Year in this deſpair, when they came and told me, that I had leave to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Portugal:</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> had made conſiderable preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for War; his Conqueſts in my Kingdom were very Succeſsful and Great; there ran a Rumour every where, that he would carry the War into <hi>Africa;</hi> they likewiſe believed in that Country, that he had a Deſign of Beſieging <hi>Alara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> and <hi>Tangier. Hamet</hi> alarmed at the News, repented he had helped to perſuade the World I was dead. His Counſel reſolv'd to ſet me at Liberty, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that my Perſon might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Portugals</hi> to their Duty, and interrupt the Courſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Victories. I was not ſenſible of the joy that my delivery ought to give me; my hopes had been ſo often croſt, and had been ſo often turned into Deſpair, that I durſt not truſt them. I ſaw
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57998:157"/>without Emotion my Priſon Doors opened; I followed my Leader without ſpeaking; but ſeeing he led me to a Tower, of almoſt as difficult an acceſs as that I had been Impriſoned in, I asked my Guide in a rage, if they only changed my Priſon, and if they believed an alteration of ſufferings would be a Comfort to me; he bid me follow him, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me whither I went; and when I was entred a Chamber neat enough for a Priſon, he left me alone, and returning, ſhut all the Doors. I had hardly been there a Quarter of an Hour, but I ſaw <hi>Abdeliza</hi> come out of a Neighbouring Chamber, leaning upon one of her Slaves, and was ſo changed and ſo dejected, that I fancied I rather ſaw her Ghoſt than her Perſon. <hi>What! an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment!</hi> cried I at the ſight of her, and caſting my ſelf at her Feet, <hi>Princeſs is it poſſible that I ſee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57998:157"/>you again? I am Comforted for all my misfortunes, ſeeing you are ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, tho I had been told the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and can delare to you how ſenſible I am of all you have done for me.</hi> Sir, ſaid ſhe to me, raiſing me, and embracing me tenderly, I could have wiſhed to have freed you out of Captivity even at the Expence of my life, I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered my Priſon with patience, when I conſidered the occaſion of it, and I have been more ſenſible of the rigours of yours than of all I have endured in mine. I Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Brother, <hi>continued ſhe, bathing my Face with her Tears,</hi> all that his anger could make me ſuffer, ſince he has granted me the happineſs of ſeeing you once again. Go, begone, Sir, I will not regard your Joy nor your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, you have been too long in our Priſons, and I ask you Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for all the Cruelties you have ſuffered there; Pardon them for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57998:158"/>my loves ſake; 'tis violence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to renounce the happineſs of ſeeing you, for you to make it that Sacrifice. Begone, Sir, ſaid ſhe to me, Embracing me, my Confinement is not ſo ſtrict, but that I have given Orders for all which is neceſſary for your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: You will find at your going from hence a Slave, who will Conduct you to a Ship I have cauſed to be prepared for you, and will furniſh you with all you have occaſion for in the Voyage. This Slave is faithful to me, give him leave to follow you every where, that he may ſend me Tydings of you, and put you in Mind of me, if you ſhould forget me. Adieu, Sir, I am loath to detain you any longer in Priſon; the pleaſure I have had coſts you very dear. Adieu, repeated ſhe ſeveral times, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a torrent of Tears; live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and remember me. After
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57998:158"/>having ſaid theſe Words ſhe quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, leaning upon the Maid that attended her; I ſaw her fall into a Swoon a moment after up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Cuſhions of her Chamber, that were neareſt to the Door: I would have run to have helpt her, but my Guide forc'd me from thence, and told me he had orders not to ſuffer me any longer in that place.</p>
                     <p>Having much more pity of the Condition I left that poor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in, than joy for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my Liberty, I enquired ſecretly at the Port, as ſoon as I was arrived there, of the Place you were retreated to: No one could tell me any thing certain, and ſome Marriners acquainted me, they had ſeen you in the Iſles of <hi>Terceras.</hi> I Embarqued in the Veſſel the Slave <hi>Abdeliza</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me had brought me to: We arrived at <hi>Angra,</hi> where the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57998:159"/>of my return being arriv'd ſooner than my ſelf, I perceived a far off, being ſtill at Sea, that all the People were at the Port to ſee us Diſembarque. I did not think it convenient to make known my arrival to all that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, who are more Inconſtant and Seditious in that Country than in any other place. I went into the long Boat, after having told the Captain of the Ship, that he ſhould go a-ſhore with all his Equipage at an Iſland farther of, and not divulge my arrival; and I went in the Night to a Convent the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> have in that Iſland. I remained there eight days, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſearch to be made for you in all the Neighbouring Iſlands; but <hi>Abdeliza</hi>'s Slave venturing to go out, was of a ſuddain environed by a Crowd of People, who asking him where I was, taking him for King <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him that he was the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57998:159"/>cauſe of all the Wars, they aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated him Cruelly in that place. This Sedition made me know, there was no ſafety for me in thoſe Ports; and hearing you were not there, I went from thence as unknown as I came thither. I Embarqued again in my Ship, and having at length learnt with a great deal of pain and care, that you were at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> preferring the pleaſure of ſeeing you, before the Care of my re-eſtabliſhment, and longing with impatience to know what ſhare I had in your heart, I come to render you all my love, and aſſure you, that I ſhall only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get again upon the Throne for the placing you there with me.</p>

                     <hi>Almeida</hi> tranſported with joy, to ſee the Conſtancy and return of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> had all thoſe Complaiſances for him, that a tender and an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart can be capable of. They
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57998:160"/>Deliberated together about return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Kingdom, of making Cabals in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and procuring Troops for the re-entring it. He reſolved to give notice of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Miniſters of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whom he had found the moſt Zealous, and ſent into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places to demand Succours of the Princes who had been his Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Henry</hi> was releaſed out of Slavery by the Cares of <hi>Eugenia</hi> and <hi>Souza</hi> in that time. Upon his return he learnt that <hi>Eugenia</hi> was Married again; and when he was arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> not daring to enter his own Houſe, nor ask to ſee his Wife, he went to lodge at one of his Friends, who acquainted him with all the particulars that could Juſtifie her, and give him ſome Conſolation in this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. She came to him as ſoon as ſhe had learnt where he was; caſt her ſelf at his Feet, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57998:160"/>them with Floods of Tears. She told him all that her Affection and Innocence could Suggeſt in her Vindication. He was moved; but her delicacy could not rely upon all theſe reaſons: She prayed him with all the earneſtneſs imaginable, to permit her to paſs the reſt of her time in a Convent; and he could not refuſe her ſo juſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, notwithſtanding all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he had for her. The Count of <hi>Souza,</hi> who, ſince the News of <hi>Don Henry</hi>'s being alive, had paſſed his days in the greateſt Grief ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and had abſtained from ſeeing <hi>Eugenia</hi> ſince that time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with the World, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no tie that could retain him, reſolved to put himſelf into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and was ſhut up the reſt of his days in the Convent of <hi>Beneſiges,</hi> half a League from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he died in the Sweets of a Holy Life, as the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Authors do aſſure, who have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57998:161"/>written the Hiſtory of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Care ſoever <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had taken to conceal his return, the reumour ran quickly at <hi>Venice,</hi> that a Stranger was arrived there, who had the Name and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> Even ſome <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were in that City having Examined his Shape, his Face, and his Voice, knew him for their King. The News of which being come to the Ears of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> fearing a Quarrel with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> thought themſelves oblig'd to ſeize <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> and give notice to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of all that paſſed amongſt them upon that account. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> aſſured the Republick, that this <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was an Impoſtour, and deſired he might be proceeded againſt as ſuch, Commiſſioners were deputed before whom he maintained with firmneſs, that he was <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> that he had been detained till then in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57998:161"/>of <hi>Africa;</hi> and that he came to recover the Crown that was due to him by his Birth. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes,</hi> who were in that City maintained his aſſeverations: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi> aſcertained he had told her things that only <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could know. He ſhewed upon his Body very particular Marks that Nature had Imprinted there, and which he was obſerv'd to have when he was King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He appealed to his Judges, the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of great Conſideration, who had been Ambaſſadours for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick in his Kingdom, and told them the moſt ſecret Affairs they had particularly treated of at that time with him. In fine, he ſo well repreſented all the Proofs, and all the Circumſtances that might make him known to be the King, that <hi>Don Sebaſtians</hi> Judges could not do any thing more than Baniſh him from <hi>Venice. Almeida</hi> would have followed him, to help him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57998:162"/>his misfortunes; but he cauſed her to ſtay in that City, till he ſhould have ſettled his Affairs. He made towards <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where he thought to meet with ſome Friends, and ſome favourable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who had been at the Battel.</p>
                  <p>The Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to furniſh him with ſome Troops. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> was his Couſin; he went to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore her Succours: She received him with all the Joy and all the Kindneſs that a Good Relation can be capable of; but ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grant him Forces nor Money: All the Favour ſhe could do him, was to give him an Equipage becoming his Quality. He thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſend to the <hi>Cortes</hi> or States of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to give them notice of the ſtate he was in, and where he was. The Dutcheſs furniſhed him with People of great Experience in thoſe kind of Negotiations. They went and acquainted the States of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57998:162"/>
                     <hi>Portugal</hi> with the Fate of their King. This Deputation cauſed great joy and ſurprize through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They ſent to <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> ſix of the Principal Men of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. They ſaw him; the reſpect which the Majeſty of Kings occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeized them at firſt ſight: <hi>Don Henry</hi> and <hi>Phoebus Monis</hi> were of the Number of theſe Envoy's, they could not miſtake him, and Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Knees, they conjured him to deliver them from the oppreſſion of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The others for fear of being miſtaken by too much reſemblance, asked the King ſeveral Queſtions, which no one but <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could reply to. They were likewiſe ſurpriz'd to ſee ſo much preſence of Mind, and ſo much Memory in his Anſwers. Theſe Envoys returned into <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and reported, that it was the real <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> they had ſpoke to. The Partizans of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom all the Kingdom was full of, accuſed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57998:163"/>theſe Envoys of Impoſture, and mantained that they had ſuffered themſelves to be Suborned by an Impoſtour. Others demanded that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſhould come in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf to the Aſſembly of the States General, to be Examined there in all the Forms. He was ready to depart to be preſent there, but the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſome of his Priends, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, hindred him, telling him, that the States were only Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of People Pentioners to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> that the true <hi>Portugals</hi> were no longer Maſters there, and that there was no ſafety for him.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was preparing to enter <hi>Spain</hi> at the head of ſome Forces, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cauſed him to be Seized, to prevent his doing ſo, he was carried to <hi>Naples,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Publick Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they made him ſuffer, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made appear the greatneſs of his Soul, and never bely'd his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57998:163"/>in the leaſt. They drew up his Proceſs a-new, they would have put him to death in the Forms; but notwithſtanding all that the worſt of Envy was capable of inventing againſt him, the injuſtice of his Judges durſt not attempt the life of ſo great a King, and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to the Gallies for to appeaſe in ſome manner the rage of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. <hi>Almeida</hi> entred the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſt after the Sentence had been read to him. What a Deſolation for her and for him! The Grief of thoſe two Lovers is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. But that Princeſs more lively reſenting that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had all thoſe outrages done to him, died in his Arms of Grief and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, for having reduced ſo Great a King into ſo deplorable a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was Shaved and carried to the Gallies. The moſt Tragical Hiſtorians durſt never offer to our Eyes, ſuch a ſpectacle, as to ſee Chain'd, in the midſt of a hundred
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57998:164"/>Malefactors of the Scum of the People, a Formidable and Powerful King, whoſe Mind and Body were enriched with a thouſand Beautiful Qualities, and to whom no other Crime can be imputed than his misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, and ever beſtowing ſome ſighs to the memory of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> leagued together, and openly demanded their King, but it was in vain; one rarely conſents to reſtore a Crown, and Policy abhors that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Virtue. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill Conſequences of theſe Cabals and Leagues, and fearing that <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> whom they ever took for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour, might be ſtill capable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deplorable Condition he was reduced to, to deprive them of the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> reſolved to make ſure of his Perſon. They took him from the Gallies, they cauſed him to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſecretly into <hi>Spain,</hi> and Impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Lucar,</hi> where 'tis reported, this deplorable King was Poiſoned in a ſhort time after, and with ſo Tragical an End did Crown a Life that had been filled with ſo many Misfortunes.</p>
